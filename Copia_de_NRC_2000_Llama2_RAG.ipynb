All rights reserved.\\n1 \\nWith finite land resources and increasing world pop\\xad\\nulation, the use of animals is required to maximize food \\nproduction and maintain the quality of life. Efficient \\nanimal production is not possible unless nutrient re\\xad\\nquirements are met. This edition of Nutrient Require\\xad\\nments of Beef Cattle is an extensive revision of the fifth \\nedition, published in 1976. \\nTypes of beef cattle have changed in response to eco\\xad\\nnomic pressures and consumer demand for leaner \\nmeats. The basic biology of all beef cattle is similar, but \\ndifferences in mature size and rate of maturing have a \\nmarked influence on application of basic nutrition prin\\xad\\nciples to the wide range of environmental and manage\\xad\\nment conditions of practice. For this reason, the frame \\nsize of the animal has been considered in calculating nu\\xad\\ntrient requirements. The medium-frame steer was con\\xad\\nsidered to have 450 to 520 kg live weight at usual market \\nfinish and the medium-frame heifer, 400 to 475 kg. The \\nfinished weight was considered to be over 520 and 475 \\nkg for large-frame steers and heifers, respectively . Re\\xad\\nquirements are given for yearling steers and heifers \\nshowing compensatory growth (compensating yearling \\nheifers and steers). Nutrient requirements have been de\\xad\\ntermined for growing and finishing bulls, as bull feeding \\nfor carcass beef has become an important segment of the \\ncattle feeding industry. \\nGrowing and finishing cattle requirements for en\\xad\\nergy, protein, calcium, and phosphorus in amounts per \\nday are presented in separate tables. Nutrient require\\xad\\nments expressed as nutrient concentrations in diet dry \\nmatter have been calculated from estimated feed intake \\nand are presented in avoirdupois units. For the breeding \\nherd, daily nutrient requirements and nutrient require\\xad\\nments expressed as nutrient concentrations in diet dry \\nmatter are presented in the same table.

Nutri\\xad\\ntionists now standardize their combustion (bomb) calo\\xad\\nrimeters using specifically purified benzoic acid, theca\\xad\\nloric value of which has been determined in electrical \\nunits and computed in terms of joules/ g mole. The calo\\xad\\nrie has, therefore, been standardized to equal 4.184 \\njoules (Moore, 1977). This is approximately the amount \\nof heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water \\nfrom 16.5° to 17.5°C. The joule and the calorie are in\\xad\\nterchangeable, and each is a defined unit; neither is \\nmore absolute. The calorie represents a small amount of \\nenergy; thus, the kilogram calorie ( 1 kcal = 1000 calo\\xad\\nries) and the megacalorie (1 Meal = 1,000,000 calories \\n... 1000 kilocalories) are more convenient to use in con\\xad\\njunction with animal feeding standards . \\nGross energy (E) is the heat released (heat of combus\\xad\\ntion) when an organic substance is completely oxidized \\nto carbon dioxide and water. Gross energy is related to \\nchemical composition. For example, Nehring and \\nHaenlein ( 1973) relate gross energy of feedstuffs to their \\nproximate constituents by the relationship: \\nE, kcal/100 g = 5.72 (crude protein, percent) + 9.5 \\n(ether extract, percent) + 4.79 \\n(crude fiber, percent) + 4.03 \\n(nitrogen-free extract, percent). \\nGross energy contained in a feedstuff is of limited use \\nfor assessing the value of a particular ingredient or diet \\nas an energy source for animals. It does not provide in\\xad\\nformation regarding the availability of the energy to the \\nanimal. \\n2 Nutrient \\nRequirentents: \\nExcesses and \\nDefidendes \\nExpressing Energy Values of Feedstuffs \\nThe gross energy of a food minus the energy lost in the \\nfeces is termed digestible energy (DE). An approxi\\xad\\nmately equivalent term, total digestible nutrients \\n(TON), attempts to measure digestible energy in weight \\nunits. TON has no advantages over DE as the unit to \\ndescribe feed values or to express animal requirements \\n(Maynard, 1953). TON can be converted to DE by the \\nrelationship 1 kg of TON = 4.4 Meal of DE (Schneider \\nand Flatt, 1975). DE has the advantage of ease of mea\\xad\\nsurement but fails to consider all losses of energy associ\\xad\\nated with the digestion and metabolism of food nutri\\xad\\nents. The major weakness of DE as a basis for feeding \\nsystems is that it overestimates the available energy of \\nhigh-fiber feedstuffs (hays, straws) relative to low-fiber, \\nhighly digestible products, such as grains. \\nMetabolizable energy (ME) is a measure of the di\\xad\\netary energy available for metabolism after energy \\nlosses that occur in the urine (UE), and the combustible \\ngases (chiefly methane) are subtracted from digestible \\nenergy. ME has many of the same deficiencies as a basis \\nfor feeding systems as DE, because urinary energy losses \\nand energy lost as methane are relatively predictable \\nfrom DE; therefore, DE and ME are highly correlated . \\nME is most valuable as the starting point for nearly all \\nsystems of feed evaluation that are based on net energy \\nconcepts. \\nClassically , net energy is the net quantity of energy \\nthat is recovered (RE) in an animal product. RE can be a \\nnegative quantity for animals fed below their mainte\\xad\\nnance requirements. The use of net energy as the basis \\nfor a system of feed evaluation is complicated by the fact \\nthat the ME available from an animal's diet is used at \", metadata={'source': '/content/19398.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",

These \\ncomplications have been partially accounted for in a net \\nenergy system for beef cattle by the convention that as\\xad\\nsigns two net energy values to each feedstuff. Animal \\nrequirements for energy are similarly subdivided. Net \\nenergy available or required for maintenance is termed \\nNEm, and net energy available or required for growth is \\ntermed NEg (Lofgreen and Garrett, 1968; NRC, \\n1981a). Two major advantages of the net energy system \\nare: (a) animal requirements stated as net energy are \\nindependent of the diet, i.e., do not have to be adjusted \\nfor different roughage-concentrate ratios, and (b) feed \\nrequirements for maintenance are estimated separately \\nfrom feed needed for the productive functions. \\nInterconversions between DE, ME, and NE values of \\nfeedstuff are possible. The following relationships have \\nbeen estimated (all units are Meal/kg DM): \\nME = 0.82 DE (NRC, 1976; ARC, 1965). \\nNEm = 1.37 ME -0.138 ME2 +. 0.0105 ME3 -1.12 \\n(Garrett, 1980a). \\nNEg = 1.42 ME -0.174 ME2 + 0.0122 ME3 -1.65 \\n(Garrett, 1980a). \\nAnimal Requirements for Energy \\nThe maintenance requirement for energy can be de\\xad\\nfined as that amount of feed energy that will result in no \\nloss or gain in body energy. For some beef animals near \\ntheir mature size (adult bulls, for example), mainte\\xad\\nnance may be the usual physiological state and the prac\\xad\\ntical feeding goal. Maintenance in most other beef ani\\xad\\nmals is more a theoretical condition that differs from the \\nusual physiological or practical state. Nevertheless it is \\nconvenient and appropriate to consider maintenance \\nenergy requirements separately from any production re\\xad\\nquirement. Net energy required for maintenance is, by \\ndefinition, the amount of energy equivalent to the fast\\xad\\ning heat production. The NEm requirements for mainte\\xad\\nnance of beef cattle have been estimated as 77 kcal/ \\nW0·75; W is body weight in kilograms (Lofgreen and \\nGarrett, 1968; Garrett, 1980a). Maintenance require\\xad\\nments estimated by this expression are most applicable \\nfor penned animals in nonstressful environments with \\nminimal activity. There are variations in maintenance \\nrequirements based on sex and breed (Garrett, 1971; \\nFrisch and Vercoe, 1977; Webster, 1978). Physiological \\nage also has an influence (Geay, 1982). The magnitude \\nof these effects appears to be from 3 to 14 percent. In \\ngeneral, breeds and individuals maturing at heavier \\nweights may require more, and Bos indicus breeds and \\ncrosses may require less energy for maintenance than \\nwould be estimated by the expression 77 wo.75. Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 3 \\nThe efficiency of ME utilization must be considered \\nin order to estimate the quantity of ME or DE (TDN) \\nrequired for maintenance. The efficiency of ME use for \\nmaintenance or gain can be calculated for feedstuffs or \\nmixed diets by using the relationship between NEm and \\nME or NEg and ME. Some values are given as examples \\nin the table below. TDN and DE requirements were ob\\xad\\ntained by the conversion 1 kg TDN = 3.62 Meal of ME \\nand DE = ME/0.82 (NRC, 1976). \\nEfficiency of ME Use for Maintenance and Gain \\nEfficiency of ME \\nApproximate utilization \\nME Concentration Roughage: \\n(Meal/kg) Concentrate\" Maintenance Gain \\n2.0 100:0 57.6 29.6 \\n2.2 83:17 60.8 34.6 \\n2.4 67:33 63.3 38.5 \\n2.6 50:50 65.1 41.5 \\n2.8 33:67 66.6 43.9 \\n3.0 17:83 67.7 45.8 \\n3.2 0:100 68.6 47.3 \\n0 Assuming average quality roughage contains 2.0 Meal/kg and that the aver· \\nage concentrate contains 3.2 Meal/kg. \\nThe NE requirements for growth (NEg) are estimated \\nas the amount of energy deposited as nonfat organic \\nmatter (mostly protein) plus that deposited as fat. The \\ncaloric value of fat is 9.4 kcal/g, and for the nonfat or\\xad\\nganic matter an average value is 5.6 kcal/g. The quanti\\xad\\nties of protein and fat being deposited are related to two \\nfactors: (a) the intake of energy above the maintenance \\nrequirement (assuming all other nutrient requirements \\nare also satisfied) and (b) the impetus to grow (i.e., the \\nphase of growth or weight obtained relative to mature \\nweight). For most conditions (continuously grown ani\\xad\\nmals or mature animals without severely depleted en\\xad\\nergy stores), the energy content of a unit weight gain \\nwill be between 1.2 and 8.0 Meal/kg. These figures are \\nthe energy content of the fat-free body (73 percent wa\\xad\\nter, 22 percent protein, 5 percent minerals) (Reid et al., \\n1955; Garrett and Hinman, 1969) and an average en\\xad\\nergy content of adipose tissue. The composition of adi\\xad\\npose tissue is variable between depots and with the total \\nfatness of the animal, but it is unlikely to contain more \\nthan 85 percent fat as an average of all depots (Berg and \\nButterfield, 1976; Loveday and Dikeman, 1980). All re\\xad\\nlationships to estimate the caloric value of weight gain \\nhave been determined for some particular breeds and \\nsex classes and therefore may have to be adjusted for \\nmost precise use for other breed types and conditions \\n(see ARC, 1980, for a review).

The unit for \\nRE is Meal/day. The NEg is equivalent to theRE. \\nThese basic relationships are easily modified for ap\\xad\\nplication to specific practical conditions. For example, \\ninformation summarized by Garrett (1980a) indicates \\nthat cattle that have not received hormonal adjuvants \\ncontain about 5 percent more energy per unit gain. The \\nsteer equation modifed for application to nonimplanted \\nanimals would be: \\nRE = 1.05 (0.0635 W0.7s EBGL097) \\n= 0.0667 W0·75 EBGL097 (3) \\nOther modifications of the primary equations ( 1 and \\n2) can be made to estimate RE or NEg requirements of \\ncattle with other frame sizes or sex classes. An example \\nmodification of equation 1 to make it more suitable for \\nuse with large-frame steer calves and medium-frame \\nbulls follows. \\nThe assumption is that energy retention of a large\\xad\\nframe calf or medium-frame bull is approximately \\nequivalent to a medium-frame steer of a 15 percent \\nlighter weight. Equation 1 becomes: \\nRE = 0.0635 (0.85 W)o.7s EBGL097 \\n= 0.0562 W0·75 EBGL097 (4) \\nOther modifications of the primary equations ( 1 and \\n2) have been made to estimate the energy requirements \\nof large-frame bulls and heifers (see Prediction Equa\\xad\\ntions). \\nThe examples given in the preceding paragraphs are \\nmeant to illustrate that general relationships between \\nEBG and energy gain need adjustments for specific con\\xad\\nditions in practice. The extent of the modification neces\\xad\\nsary is related to differences in body composition rela\\xad\\ntive to weight and age and the influence of these variables on energy utilization (Garrett, 1971; Webster, \\n1978; Byers and Rompala, 1980; Garrett, 1980b). \\nThe primary equations (1 and 2) and the modified \\nversions discussed are on an empty body weight basis. \\nUnder practical conditions, empty body weights and \\nEBGs are not known. The previous edition of this report \\n(NRC, 1976) did not make a distinction between empty \\nbody weight and live weight (L W). The present sub\\xad\\ncommittee has decided to list the requirements in Tables \\n1 and 2 on an L W basis. L W is defined as weight after an \\novernight feed and water shrink (generally equivalent to \\nabout 96 percent of unshrunk weights taken in the early \\nmorning) . The decision to list requirements on an L W \\nbasis makes it necessary to modify the primary energy \\nrequirement equations. Two adjustments are necessary: \\n(1) EBG should be adjusted to a shrunk weight gain \\n(LWG) basis. A multiple regression equation calculated \\nfrom a data set with observations from 3500 cattle re\\xad\\nceiving various diets (Garrett, unpublished) is EBG = \\n0.93 LWG + 0.174 NEm -0.28; r = 0.96; SE = \\n0.014; (2) The mean live weight (MLW) determined as \\n[0.5 (initial weight + final weight)] should be adjusted \\nto a mean empty body weight (MEBW) basis. The same \\ndata set (Garrett, unpublished) gives the following mul\\xad\\ntiple regression : \\nMEBW = 0.88 MLW + 14.6 NEm -22.9; r = 0.98; \\nSE = 1.5. \\nThese equations could be substituted directly in the \\nprimary energy equations to estimate retained energy \\n(NEg requirements for LWG). However, the relation\\xad\\nships were established under specific experimental con\\xad\\nditions, and it is not known how applicable they are to \\nweights and weight gains observed under the widely \\nvarying conditions of cattle production. For this reason \\nthe subcommittee adopted the simple approach of using \\naverage ratios of EBG to LWG (0.956) and MEBW to \\nMLW (0.891) to adjust the primary equations to an LW \\nbasis. The ratios are the coefficients calculated using a \\nno-intercept regression of EBG versus L WG and EBW \\nversus L W from the data set mentioned earlier. This \\nsimple approach might be expected to underestimate \\nLW gains of cattle fed high-roughage diets and to over\\xad\\nestimate the L W gains of those fed very high concen\\xad\\ntrate diets. For further information and another ap\\xad\\nproach to the solution of the empty body weight to LW \\nconversion problems, the reader is referred to ARC, \\n1980, p. 38. \\nThe relationship used to estimate maintenance re\\xad\\nquirements (77 Kcal!W 0·75 as originally determined) \\nalso has weight on an empty body basis. The decision \\nnot to adjust this estimate is largely arbitrary .

A decreased \\nmaintenance requirement under practical (as opposed \\nto the experimental) environments does not (intuitively, \\nat least} seem likely. Also, gut contents have to be car\\xad\\nried and maintained at near-body temperatures . There\\xad\\nfore, a refinement of the maintenance estimate may not \\nbe appropriate at this time, particularly since any \\nchange contemplated would be within the error at\\xad\\ntached to the unadjusted estimate. \\nCurrent information is inadequate to modify the \\npresent general system describing the energy value of \\nfeeds and the energy requirements of cattle for all condi\\xad\\ntions encountered in production situations . Users are en\\xad\\ncouraged to adjust the primary equations to fit their spe\\xad\\ncific practical conditions if continued use of the energy \\nrequirements given in the tables or by the equations in\\xad\\ndicates a consistent over-or underestimation of animal \\nperformance. Some other procedures for adjusting gen\\xad\\nerally determined energy requirements to specific con\\xad\\nditions have been suggested by Garrett (1976}, Webster \\n(1978}, ARC (1980}, and Fox and Black (1984}. \\nThe primary equations to predict energy require\\xad\\nments have been rearranged to estimate daily gain when \\nanimal weight and feed consumption are known: \\n( RE )0.9116 For steers: EBG = 12.341 W0.75 \\n12.341 W -0.6837RE0.9116.

Similar equations for bulls, cattle of other frame \\nsizes, and all relationships modified to an L W basis are \\ngiven in Appendix Table 10. \\nEnergy deposition in the conceptus of beef females \\nhas been determined by Ferrell et al.

The gross effi\\xad\\nciency of ME use for conceptus development has been \\nestimated as 11 to 15 percent for cattle (Ferrell et al., \\n1976b} and 12 to 13 percent for sheep (Rattray et al., \\n1974}. The average figure of 13 percent was used to esti-Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 5 \\nmate the ME requirement for pregnancy and converted \\nto equivalent NEm units to express requirements in net \\nenergy terms. The relationship used to estimate the \\npregnancy requirement [kcal/day of NEm equivalent \\nbased on expected calf birth weight and day of gestation \\n(t}] assuming a diet of average quality forage (ME of \\n2.00 Meal/kg} is: \\nNEm = calf birth weight \\n(0.0149 -0.0000407t)e0 .05883t-o.0000804t 2 \\nThe energy requirements for milk production have \\nbeen estimated from the information available for the \\ndairy cow (NRC, 1978). The requirement can be calcu\\xad\\nlated and expressed in NEm units since ME is utilized for \\nlactation and maintenance at similar levels of effi\\xad\\nciency. \\nNEm (Meal/kg of milk} = 0.1 (percent fat} + 0.35. \\nThe total energy requirement determined by adding \\nthe maintenance and lactation requirements should be \\nadequate to prevent weight loss in most lactating cattle \\nnot under environmental stress. Under many practical \\nconditions the beef cow may seasonally lose weight (at \\ncalving and during early lactation) and gain weight \\n(late lactation and during the nonlactation period). The \\npossibility for increased calving percentages and main\\xad\\ntenance of a once-a-year calving interval may be im\\xad\\nproved if the cow does not lose weight during late gesta\\xad\\ntion and the breeding season. \\nThe weight increase of thin nonlactating adult beef \\ncows (exclusive of products of conception} probably \\ncontains between 5 and 12 percent protein and 50 and \\n75 percent fat. This is equivalent to 5.5 to 7.5 kcal/g \\n(Garrett, 1974b; Swingleet al., 1979; ARC, 1980}. The \\naverage value of 6.5 kcal/g can be used to approximate \\nthe empty body weight gain of thin beef cows. \\nVery little extra energy is required above mainte\\xad\\nnance for semen production and replenishment in ma\\xad\\nture bulls (Flipse and Almquist, 1961; Van Demark and \\nManger, 1964}. \\nEnergy requirements listed in all tables in this report \\nassume the animals are not stressed by environmental \\nconditions .

Information re\\xad\\ngarding the effect of environment on energy require\\xad\\nments is summarized in Chapter 5 of this publication. \\nPROTEIN \\nThe preruminant calf has little rumen function, so \\nprotein nutrition parallels that for the nonruminant. \\nAmino acid requirements can be met through milk or \\nmilk replacers (Roy and Stobo, 1975). Supplementing \\nwith certain amino acids may prove beneficial (Folda\\xad\\nger et al., 1977), but urea usefulness is limited (Morrill \\nand Dayton, 1978). Milk substitutes should meet pro\\xad\\ntein requirements specified in the tables in this report, \\nwhile creep supplements should be formulated to com\\xad\\nplement the protein and energy supplied by milk and \\ngrazed forage. After the rumen becomes functional, 6 to \\n8 weeks of age depending on diet, the crude protein \\nneeds for two systems must be met-the need for nitro\\xad\\ngen for microbial fermentation in the reticulo-rumen \\nand the need for postruminal amino acids for tissues of \\nthe host ruminant. \\nMicrobial Requirements \\nAbout 75 percent of the carbohydrate digested by ru\\xad\\nminants is fermented by microbes in the rumen. During \\nfermentation, volatile fatty acids, ammonia, methane, \\nand C02 are released, and energy is liberated for micro\\xad\\nbial growth and multiplication. A wide variety of mi\\xad\\ncrobial types, including many species of anaerobic bac\\xad\\nteria, protozoa, and even fungi, thrive in the rumen. \\nSwept out of the rumen to the abomasum and small in\\xad\\ntestine with fluid and particles, these microbes typically \\nfurnish about half of the protein (amino acids) needed \\nby the ruminant animal. Extensive reviews concerning \\ntypes, metabolism, and importance of the microbial \\npopulation of the rumen are available (Bryant, 1973; \\nSmith, 1975; Hespell, 1979). \\nRuminal bacteria can use various sourres of nitrogen \\n(primarily ammonia and some amino acids and pep\\xad\\ntides), energy (derived from fermentation), and miner\\xad\\nals for growth. Any of these factors can limit bacterial \\ngrowth since requirements are interrelated. The supply \\nof ammonia can be inadequate when either the intake of \\nprotein or the ruminal degradation of protein is low. \\nAmmonia deficiency in the rumen reduces the efficiency \\nof bacterial growth and may reduce the rate and extent \\nof digestion of organic matter in the rumen, which may \\nreduce feed intake. The minimum concentration of am\\xad\\nmonia-nitrogen in ruminal fluid needed for bacterial \\ngrowth and digestion has been estimated by various pro\\xad\\ncedures (Satter and Slyter, 1974; Mehrez et al., 1977; \\nEdwards and Bartley, 1979; Hespell, 1979; Slyter et al., 1979) with little consensus. Concentrations above 5 mg \\nammonia-nitrogen per 100 ml generally have not in\\xad\\ncreased bacterial protein production, although higher \\nconcentrations may increase both ruminal pH and or\\xad\\nganic matter digestion. \\nAmmonia is derived from degradation of protein or \\nnonprotein nitrogen (NPN) in the rumen. Although \\nmost bacterial species in the rumen can survive using \\nammonia as their sole source of nitrogen (Bryant and \\nRobinson, 1963), added protein may stimulate bacterial \\ngrowth by providing amino acids (Maeng and Baldwin, \\n1976), essential branch-chained fatty acids (Bryant, \\n1973), or unidentified factors for ruminal bacteria to in\\xad\\ncorporate or use. Typically the least costly dietary \\nsource of ruminal ammonia is some form of NPN. \\nNonprotein Nitrogen \\nThe NPN source most commonly fed to ruminant ani\\xad\\nmals is urea. Urea is rapidly hydrolyzed to ammonia in \\nthe rumen, and excessive amounts of absorbed ammonia \\ncan prove toxic to the ruminant animal. Proper manage\\xad\\nment procedures are necessary when NPN is fed both to \\nprevent ammonia toxicity and to avoid reduction in feed \\nintake. Single doses of urea at 0.3 to 0.8 g of urea per \\nkilogram of body weight have toxic effects. Toxicity can \\nbe avoided by thoroughly mixing urea with the diet and \\nsetting the maximum concentration at 1 percent of the \\ndiet dry matter or one-third of the total protein in the \\ndiet. In typical diets for beef cattle, this concentration \\nusually exceeds the amount that is needed. Slowly de\\xad\\ngraded sources of NPN help avoid ammonia intoxica\\xad\\ntion. Urea is used more completely when high-energy, \\nlow-protein diets are fed. High-concentrate diets will \\nprovide more energy for synthesis of bacterial protein \\nfrom ammonia and will increase the amount of ammo\\xad\\nnia retained in ruminal fluid due to a lower ruminal pH. \\nAmmonia absorption from the rumen and the likelihood \\nof toxicity decrease as ruminal pH declines (Bartley \\net al., 1976). When NPN is substituted for protein in a \\ndiet, special care in mineral supplementation must be \\nexercised, since most sources of protein provide substan\\xad\\ntial amounts of sulfur, potassium, and phosphorus, \\nwhich are absent in NPN sources. \\nNPN addition to a diet is useful only when the rumi\\xad\\nnal concentration of ammonia is inadequate for optimal \\nbacterial action to ( 1) digest organic matter or (2) supply \\nammonia for microbial synthesis of protein. The \\namount of urea that can be used in the rumen for synthe\\xad\\nsis of microbial protein with a specific diet theoretically \\ncan be calculated based on the amounts of (1) protein \\ndegraded to ammonia in the rumen and (2) bacterial \\nprotein synthesis. Bacterial protein synthesis usually is \\nproportional to the amount of energy available in the ', metadata={'source': '/content/19398.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

These equa\\xad\\ntions provide similar estimates of the amount of urea \\nthat can be supplemented to a diet based on its protein \\nand energy content. Unfortunately, ruminal degrada\\xad\\ntion of dietary protein is difficult to predict. Roughage \\nlevel, feed intake level, and feed processing influence \\nboth degradation of protein in the rumen and energy \\nsupply for and efficiency of bacterial growth. Conse\\xad\\nquently, these equations must be modified for specific \\nfeeding and management conditions. Additional re\\xad\\nsearch is needed to refine the factors that fit into these \\nequations before the equations can be applied success\\xad\\nfully. Several systems have evolved in the past decade \\nthat can be used to estimate urea usefulness, protein by\\xad\\npass, and postruminal requirements for ruminant ani\\xad\\nmals. The reader is referred to reviews and symposia for \\ninformation on and comparison of these systems \\n(Owens, 1982; Owens and Bergen, 1983). \\nRuminal Protein Degradation and Bypass \\nDietary protein is digested in the rumen to a variable \\ndegree depending on feed, bacterial, animal, and time \\nconditions. The balance of the dietary protein that es\\xad\\ncapes destruction in the rumen and passes to the oma\\xad\\nsum and abomasum is commonly called bypass or es\\xad\\ncape protein. (These terms will be used interchangeably \\nhere.) In addition, a small portion of the dietary protein \\npasses directly to the omasum without mixing with ru\\xad\\nminal contents. Protein escaping or bypassing ruminal \\ndestruction is either digested postruminally or is ex\\xad\\ncreted in feces. Since the extent of ruminal degradation \\nof dietary protein depends on bacterial, animal, and \\ntime conditions, in addition to chemical and physical \\nproperties characteristic of the protein, degradability is \\na variable not a constant. Hence, rate and extent of deg\\xad\\nradation rather than degradability will be discussed \\nhere. \\nIn the rumen, most protein that is soluble in ruminal Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 7 \\nfluid, plus a variable proportion of the insoluble pro\\xad\\ntein, is degraded to ammonia (Hendericlcx and Martin, \\n1963; Chalupa, 1975). Solubility alone is a poor index of \\nthe extent of degradation of protein in the rumen (Satter \\net al., 1977), except possibly with high intakes of a high\\xad\\nconcentrate diet. Current information (Chalupa, 1975; \\nSatter et al., 1977; ARC, 1980) suggests that protein \\nfrom various feedstuffs may be classified into three rela\\xad\\ntive ruminal bypass or escape categories as follows: (1) \\nlow bypass (under 40 percent)-soybean meal, peanut \\nmeal; (2) medium bypass (40 to 60 percent)-cottonseed \\nmeal, dehydrated alfalfa meal, corn grain, brewers \\ndried grains; and (3) high bypass (over 60 percent)\\xad\\nmeat meal, corn gluten meal, blood meal, feather meal, \\nfish meal. These estimates do not consider feed process\\xad\\ning conditions or animal, dietary, and microbial vari\\xad\\nables, which can markedly alter bypass, especially for \\nthe more rapidly degraded protein sources. These fac\\xad\\ntors act through modifying (1) ruminal retention time \\nfor digestion and (2) microbial activity within the ru\\xad\\nmen. Until these factors are more fully quantitated and \\nthe postruminal need for protein is more precisely de\\xad\\nscribed, the applicability of specific bypass estimates for \\nvarious feedstuffs is limited. Amino acid composition of \\nbypassed protein from a feedstuff may not parallel that \\nof the total protein in the feedstuff (Macgregor et al., \\n1978). When high bypass protein is fed, the amount of \\nNPN needed will increase since less dietary protein is \\ndegraded to ammonia in the rumen. Increased bypass or \\nescape does not ensure increased animal production, \\nhowever, since (1) bypassed protein may be poorly di\\xad\\ngested in the small intestine, (2) the balance of amino \\nacids in postruminal protein may be poor, or (3) energy \\nsupply or nutrients other than amino acids may be limit\\xad\\ning animal production. \\nPostruminal Supply and Requirements \\nThe supply of protein to the small intestine is the sum \\nof the fed protein that escapes or bypasses ruminal de\\xad\\nstruction and the microbial protein synthesized within \\nthe rumen. Efficiency of microbial growth varies with \\nspecific culture conditions, such as pH, dilution rate, \\nand limiting nutrients. Microbial protein synthesis is \\nusually correlated with the amount of organic matter \\ndigested in the reticulo-rumen. Microbial crude protein \\nsynthesized in the rumen ranges from 77 to 270 g/kg of \\norganic matter fermented (mean of 151; Thomas, \\n1973). Higher values are characteristic of roughage diets \\nand faster bacterial growth rates. \\nEfficiency of converting feed protein or nitrogen to \\nnonammonia nitrogen leaving the rumen is variable. \\nRuminal output as a percentage of protein intake may \\nexceed 100 percent.

In contrast, when ruminal \\ndegradation of protein is high, or the amount of ammo\\xad\\nnia available exceeds the bacterial need, rumina) pro\\xad\\ntein output will be less than the amount of protein con\\xad\\nsumed. In most experiments, protein flow out of the \\nrumen has been between 75 and 120 percent of protein \\nfed and generally is near 100 percent with typical diets \\ncontaining 11 to 12 percent crude protein. In this publi\\xad\\ncation an efficiency of converting (CE) dietary protein \\nto ruminal protein output of 100 percent was assumed to \\ncalculate dietary protein needs from postruminal pro\\xad\\ntein requirements. This value should be modified when \\ninformation on ruminal bypass and microbial protein \\nsynthesis permits. \\nThe crude protein (CP) requirement of cattle can be \\nsubdivided into specific metabolic costs or factors. \\nThese include metabolic fecal loss (F), endogenous uri\\xad\\nnary loss (U), scurf loss (S), and synthesized products \\ncontaining protein, including tissue growth (G), fetal \\ngrowth (C), and milk produced (M). The factorial equa\\xad\\ntion used in this publication is: CP = (F + U + S + G \\n+ C + M)/(D x BV x CE). This is derived from the \\nclassical equation in which biological value (BV) equals \\nretained plus metabolic and endogenous losses divided \\nby true digestibility (D). Components of this equation \\ncan be estimated from animal experiments. \\nMetabolic fecal protein loss (F) in grams of protein \\nper day appears to be a function of dry matter intake or \\nfecal dry matter excretion. This is the major protein cost \\nfor mature ruminants. Further information about the \\ninfluence of fiber intake on F is needed. The current esti\\xad\\nmates of metabolic fecal protein (6.25N) loss are 30 g of \\nprotein per kilogram of dry matter intake or 68 g of pro\\xad\\ntein per kilogram of dry matter output in feces (NRC, \\n1978). Metabolic fecal protein estimated from feed in\\xad\\ntake (30 x dry matter intake) is greater than that esti\\xad\\nmated from fecal dry matter output (68 x fecal output) \\nfor all diets with digestibilities over 55 percent. Which \\nequation is more appropriate is uncertain. \\nClassically, F has been considered to represent tissue \\nprotein eroded from the intestinal tract as fibrous mat\\xad\\nter is pushed through. But since much of the fecal nitro\\xad\\ngen is microbial debris, F may originate partially from \\nNPN and not be derived completely from tissue amino \\nacids. If a large proportion of the metabolic fecal pro\\xad\\ntein originates from nonspecific sources of nitrogen \\nrather than completely from nitrogen eroded from the \\nintestinal tract, the dietary protein needed to replace F \\ncan be reduced, since the inefficiencies of metabolism need not be deducted. To calculate F for beef cattle, 99 \\nprotein level comparisons in 34 publications over the \\npast 15 years in the journal of Animal Science, Journal \\nof Dairy Science, and Canadian Journal of Animal Sci\\xad\\nence were reviewed. F was estimated using data from \\ndeficient cattle only. Two factors, feed intake and the \\ntotal of other uses of protein (tissue, urinary loss, scurf \\nloss), were regressed against dietary protein intake. The \\nslopes were interpreted to represent F/(BV x D) and \\n1/(BV x D). This permitted F to be calculated. F was \\nestimated to be 33.44 g of protein per kilogram of dry \\nmatter intake. \\nTo estimate F, knowledge of feed intakes of various \\ntypes of cattle at various rates of gain is required. Two \\nequations were derived to estimate feed intake. These \\nequations were: for medium-frame steer calves, large\\xad\\nframe heifers, and medium-frame bulls, daily dry mat\\xad\\nter intake (kg) = W0·75 (0.1493 NEm -0.046 NEm2 -\\n0.0196); for breeding females, daily dry matter intake \\n(kg) = W0·75 (0.1462 NEm2 -0.0517 NEm2 -0.0074) \\nwith NEm being net energy for maintenance in Meal/kg \\nand W being the shrunk weight in kilograms. For a \\nsmaller-or larger-frame size, shrunk weight in the equa\\xad\\ntion was decreased or increased by 10 percent for steers \\nand heifers and by 5 percent for bulls. \\nTo derive the energy density of the diet needed for \\ncattle gaining at different rates, an iterative equation \\nwas used to calculate the energy content of the feed con\\xad\\nsumed to provide enough energy to support a specified \\nrate of gain and to meet the constraints imposed for in\\xad\\ntake. NEm values are minimums for the levels of perfor\\xad\\nmance listed, except where feasible NEm solutions fell \\nbelow 1. 07 Meal/kg. Since few diets containing less than \\n1.07 Meal/kg would be fed, this minimum energy den\\xad\\nsity was used in calculations, and feed supply was con\\xad\\nsidered to be limited for cattle in this category. If feed \\nintake is greater than specified for a class of cattle but \\nthe rate of gain and the protein deposition remain as \\nspecified, then protein requirements expressed on a \\ngrams per day basis will be greater than those listed in \\nthe tables in this publication. This increase will equal62 \\ng more protein daily for every kilogram increase in feed \\nintake because of the increase in metabolic fecal loss. \\nBut protein requirement, when expressed as a percent\\xad\\nage of the diet dry matter, will be lower than listed in \\nthe tables here by 2 to 6 percent for each 10 percent in\\xad\\ncrease in feed intake since required diets always contain \\nmore than 62 g of protein in a kilogram of dry matter. \\nEndogenous urinary loss (U), in grams of protein \\n(6.25N) per day, estimated from protein-free diets, can \\nbe calculated from body weight in kilograms (W) as: \\nU = 2.75 W0·5• This loss includes a portion of the nu\\xad\\ncleic acids synthesized by ruminal microorganisms.

This is accounted for by the biological value \\nadjustment . Skin, hair, and scurf loss (S) in grams per \\nday is estimated from surface area as S = 0.2 wo.s \\n(NRC, 1978). \\nTissue protein deposition in the empty body (G) in \\ngrams of protein per day has been estimated by compar\\xad\\native slaughter techniques and deuterium dilution pro\\xad\\ncedures. Protein deposition is the multiple of the rate of \\nliveweight gain and the chemical composition of the \\ngain. Composition of tissue gained depends on physio\\xad\\nlogical maturity of the animal and the rate of liveweight \\ngain. Protein deposition rates have been estimated using \\nseveral equations. Byers and Rompala (1979) suggested \\nthat: G == 0.7108 -0.1038lo~ EBW + 0.03906lo~ \\n(EBG x (mature EBW/EBW)); where EBW is empty \\nbody weight (kg), and EBG is empty body weight gain, \\nas discussed in Chapter 2 of this publication . W. N. Gar\\xad\\nrett (1980, personal communication) suggested that: G \\n(g) = ADG x (0.2422 -0.0236 x retained energy/kg \\ngain), where ADG is the average daily gain in kilo\\xad\\ngrams. Fox et al. (1982), using data from Simpfendor\\xad\\nfer, proposed that for cattle over 250 kg, G (g) = ADG \\nin kg x (0.235 -0.00026 x shrunk weight in kilo\\xad\\ngrams). R. D. Goodrich (1968, personal communica\\xad\\ntion) proposed that protein content (percent) of gain \\nwas 20.25 -0.0225 x shrunk weight in kilograms. For \\ngrowing-finishing cattle, the mean protein deposition \\nfor the abOve equations was calculated over the weight \\nrange of 250 to 500 kg and rates of live weight gain from \\n0.5 to 1.5 kg daily, assuming that a mature weight \\nwould be 750 kg. For 350-to 400-kg cattle gaining 1 kg \\ndaily, values for these equations are similar. The mean \\nvalues for protein deposition from these equations were \\nregressed against energy content of weight gained calcu\\xad\\nlated from the net energy equations. The generated \\nequation was: protein deposition (g) = daily gain in kg \\nx (268 -29.4 x energy content of gain in Meal/kg); r2 \\n= 0. 964. As in the net energy equations, protein compo\\xad\\nsition of gain of bulls and large-frame steers was as\\xad\\nsumed to be equal to that of medium-frame steers of 15 \\npercent lower weight. For medium-framed heifers, the \\ncomposition of gain was considered to be equal to that of \\nmedium-frame steers weighing 15 percent more than \\nthe shrunk weight of heifers. These factors are based \\npartly on suggestions of Minish and Fox (1982). \\nProtein deposition in the products of conception (C) \\naccelerates as pregnancy progresses, but over the last \\nthird of pregnancy C averages 55 g per day according to \\nthe equation of Prior and Laster (1979). Protein output \\nin milk (M) in grams per day is the multiple of milk pro-Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 9 \\nduction and milk protein percentage . Milk production \\nvaries with breed but generally ranges from 3 to 10 kg \\ndaily (Lamond et al., 1969; Williams et al., 1979), and \\nprotein content averages 3.35 percent. \\nTrue protein digestibility (D), which is protein digest\\xad\\nibility corrected for metabolic fecal loss, and biological \\nvalue (BV) vary among feedstuffs and dietary condi\\xad\\ntions. Small-intestinal apparent digestibility of amino \\nacid nitrogen from feed plus microbial protein has aver\\xad\\naged 66 percent (Armstrong and Hutton, 1975; Zinn \\nand Owens, 1983), but true digestibility in the total \\ntract is near 90 percent. When estimating nitrogen \\nneeds to replace factored use of nitrogen, the higher fig\\xad\\nure must be used. Digestibility of bypassed protein can \\nvary with feedstuffs and processing methods such as \\nheat treatment. Heating of forage can reduce protein \\ndigestibility drastically . True digestibility of feed pro\\xad\\ntein can be estimated through pepsin or acid detergent \\nfiber digestion techniques . Because of heat damage, the \\ntrue digestibility estimate of feeds may need to be re\\xad\\nduced from the 90 percent estimate used in the calcula\\xad\\ntions here. \\nThe BV of microbial crude protein, estimated from \\nstudies with nonruminants, has ranged from 66 to 81 \\npercent. The high nucleic acid content of microbial cells \\nis partially responsible for this low biological value. Ni\\xad\\ntrogen recycling by ruminants will increase apparent \\nBV. For calculating requirements, protein intake of de\\xad\\nficient cattle was regressed against total protein use \\n(gain, urinary loss, scurf loss, metabolic fecal protein). \\nThis regression revealed an efficiency of use of 60 per\\xad\\ncent. This factor would be the multiple of BV and di\\xad\\ngestibility . If true digestibility of protein is 90 percent, \\nBV would be 66 percent. Postruminal infusion of certain \\namino acids (lysine, threonine, and amino acids con\\xad\\ntaining sulfur) can increase the apparent biological \\nvalue of microbial protein for steers (Chalupa , 1975). \\nHowever, supplementation of these amino acids beyond \\nthe rumen in growing cattle fed high amounts of higher\\xad\\nenergy, urea-supplemented diets has not consistently \\nimproved apparent biological value. \\nProtein requirements estimated by this factorial \\nmethod were compared with results from the 99 com\\xad\\nparisons mentioned previously.

Compared with \\nthis data base, protein requirements estimated by the \\nfactorial method underestimated the true requirement \\nin 39 percent of the cases where gain responses were seen \\nto added protein, overestimated the true requirement in \\n21 percent of the cases where no response was observed \\nto added protein, but correctly predicted response to \\nadded protein in 68 percent of the cases, including both \\ndeficient and adequately supplemented cattle. The \\nlisted requirements should be sufficient for a given class \\nof cattle in 50 percent of the cases. The standard devia\\xad\\ntion in the protein requirement was 14 percent of the \\nestimated requirement. To calculate adequate require\\xad\\nments for cattle in 84 percent of the trials, an additional \\n14 percent must be added to minimum protein require\\xad\\nments presented in Tables 2 and 10. Additional protein \\nmay be economically justified under certain feeding \\nconditions, but adding an additional 28 percent to the \\nlisted values to meet estimated needs in 95 percent of the \\ntrials reported in the literature may not be economically \\nfeasible. \\nBecause of efficiency of protein use, each gram of di\\xad\\netary protein deficiency should decrease protein deposi\\xad\\ntion by 1.7 g and rate of gain by about 10 g per day. A \\nhigher protein level, with a safety margin, may prove \\nadvantageous when the cost of protein is low relative to \\nenergy. Furthermore, providing protein in amounts \\nhigher than specified in the tables in this publication \\nmay increase animal performance early in a feeding pe\\xad\\nriod, although cattle fed a lower-protein diet will make \\ncompensatory gains later. Requirements to maximize \\ngain when starting cattle on feed may be higher than the \\naverage requirement for cattle during an entire finish\\xad\\ning period. With certain diets, supplemental protein \\nmay be withdrawn for heavier cattle when other nutri\\xad\\nents are provided in adequate amounts. Compared with \\npreviously estimated protein requirements, those listed \\nin this publication recommend higher amounts early in \\nthe finishing period and lower amounts late in the fin\\xad\\nishing period. \\nProtein is often fed at levels in excess of the absolute \\nrequirements of growing cattle because of the low mar\\xad\\nginal cost of protein. In contrast, feeding protein in ex\\xad\\ncess of requirements is infrequent with lactating beef \\ncows that obtain their other nutrients from grazed for\\xad\\nage. The economic sacrifices in performance and repro\\xad\\nduction and the potential for use and replenishment of \\nprotein reserves must be balanced against the cost of \\nfeeding protein to cattle to determine the most economi\\xad\\ncal level of supplementation. \\nRequirements are no longer presented on a digestible \\nprotein basis because metabolic fecal protein makes up a \\nlarge proportion of the apparently indigestible protein. Previously, most of the digestible protein requirements \\nand feed protein digestibilities were calculated from \\ncrude protein figures. \\nRequirements on the basis of percentage in the diet \\nhave been calculated from feed intake. Amounts per day \\nrather than percentage requirements should be used \\nwhen feed intakes deviate from listed values. Certain \\nadditional factors, such as heat, cold or shipment stress, \\ndiet processing, feed additives, estrogenic implants, and \\nprevious protein and energy intakes, may alter feed in\\xad\\ntake, rate of weight gain, and composition of tissue \\ngain. Adjustments for the effects of these factors on feed \\nintake and the rate of protein deposition are discussed \\nin another publication (NRC, 1981) and are not well \\nquantitated. \\nProtein Deficiencies and Toxicities \\nAmmonia deficiency in the rumen reduces the rate \\nand extent of digestion and may reduce feed intake. \\nPostruminal amino acid deficiencies also may reduce \\nenergy intake and efficiency of feed and protein use. \\nThrough recycling nitrogen to the rumen, efficiency of \\nprotein use is greatest with a marginal protein defi\\xad\\nciency. Requirements for protein listed in Tables 2, 6, \\n10, and 11 may be inadequate for certain diets and feed\\xad\\ning conditions. When protein constitutes less than 10 \\npercent of the dietary dry matter, ammonia may be in\\xad\\nsufficient for ruminal microbes. The amount of ammo\\xad\\nnia needed for rumina} microbes can be calculated from \\nthe urea potential equations given earlier. \\nBased on results of the literature survey mentioned \\nearlier, a change in feed intake may be useful as an indi\\xad\\ncator of protein deficiency. If the intake of feed in\\xad\\ncreases when protein is added to the diet, protein was \\nprobably deficient, while if intake does not increase, \\nprotein probably was not a limiting factor. Protein \\nconcentrations above the table values may increase \\nefficiency of feed use slightly, but the economics of feed\\xad\\ning excessive amounts of protein must be carefully \\nconsidered. \\nDiets containing up to 40 percent protein have been \\nfed to steers. Feed intake was reduced for several days \\nwhen protein was added, but no signs of ammonia toxic\\xad\\nity were evident (Fenderson and Bergen, 1976). Ex\\xad\\ncesses of NPN or soluble protein may precipitate ammo\\xad\\nnia toxicity, as discussed earlier. \\nHow Protein Requirements Were Calculated \\nThe method used to estimate protein requirements \\nwill be illustrated for a 250-kg medium-frame steer calf \\ngaining 1.2 kg daily.

To calculate the protein requirements for \\npregnant and lactating cattle, the need for added energy \\nfor the developing fetus or for milk production would be \\nadded. An NEm for the diet to be used was estimated and \\nfeedintakecalculated(kg = [0.1493NEm- 0.046NE~ \\n-0.0196] W0·75). Daily NEm and NEg supplies were \\nthen computed and compared with the energy needed \\nfor maintenance and gain. The level of NEm in the \\nplanned diet was then decreased or increased until the \\nfeed intake predicted by the intake equation matched \\nthe need for energy calculated from the net energy equa\\xad\\ntion. For this steer a dietary NEm of 1.81 Meal/kg should \\nbe consumed in adequate quantities (6.28 kg) to pro\\xad\\nduce a 1.2-kg daily gain. The 6.28-kg intake was used to \\ncalculate metabolic fecal protein loss (33.44 g protein \\nper kg of dry matter intake = 210 g). Endogenous uri\\xad\\nnary protein loss (2.75 W0·5) and scurf loss (0.2 W0·6) \\nequal43.5 and 5.5 g daily. Based on energy content of \\ngain (4.28 Meal NEg deposited per 1.2 kg weight = 3.56 \\nMeal/kg gain}, the protein deposited is calculated (gain \\nin kg x [268 -29.4 x energy content of gain in Meal! \\nkg]) = 196 g. Protein deposition plus fecal, urinary, and \\nscurf loss totals 455 g per day. (Protein deposition in \\nmilk or in the developing fetus if appropriate would be \\nadded here.) At a true digestibility of 90 percent, a bio\\xad\\nlogical value of absorbed amino acids of 66 percent, and \\nan assumed efficiency of 100 percent for converting di\\xad\\netary protein to protein leaving the rumen, the daily di\\xad\\netaryproteinneedis455/(0.90 x 0.66 x 1.00) = 766g. \\nAs a proportion of the dry matter in the diet (6.28 kg), \\nthe protein requirement equals 12.2 percent. \\nAn alternative approach is to project intake, perfor\\xad\\nmance, and protein requirements for cattle fed a diet \\ncontaining a specified level of energy. For example, \\nwith a diet having an NEm of 1.6Mcal!kgfed toa350-kg \\nlarge-frame bull, dry matter intake (0.1493 NEm -\\n0.046NE~- .0196) x (1.05 x W)·75shouldbe8.52kg \\nper day. Fecal protein loss would be 285 g daily (33.44 \\nx 8.52). This amount of feed provides energy for main\\xad\\ntenance (6.23 Mcal/1.6 Meal per kg = 3.89 kg feed), \\nleaving 4.63 Meal NEg ([8.52 -3.89 kg] x 1.0 Meal \\nNEg), which will support a daily gain of 1.28 kg (17.35 \\nNEg9116 W-.6837) as calculated from the net energy equa\\xad\\ntions. The energy content of gain is 3.62 Meal/kg (4.63 \\nMeal NEg/1.28 kg) for a daily protein gain of 207 g (1.28 \\nx [268 -29.4 x 3.62]). Urinary loss and scurf loss \\nwould total51.4 and 6.7 g protein per day for a total \\ndaily protein use of 550 g. With a 90 percent digestibil\\xad\\nity, a biological value of 66 percent, and a ruminal effi\\xad\\nciency of protein output at 100 percent of intake, the \\ncrude protein requirement is 926 g per day. As a portion \\nof the predicted dry matter intake (8.52 kg), this equals \\n10.9 percent crude protein. Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 11 \\nThe amount of the dietary protein that can be pro\\xad\\nvided as NPN can be solved from the urea utilization \\nequations outlined earlier providing the extent of rumi\\xad\\nnal degradation of dietary protein can be predicted. \\nProper management must be exercised to avoid NPN \\ntoxicity, as discussed earlier. These equations were de\\xad\\nrived from the relationships mentioned earlier assuming \\nthat all nonprotein nitrogen is degraded to ammonia \\nwithin the rumen and is used with an efficiency equal to \\nammonia released from dietary protein. The prediction \\nequations are: \\nIP = (7.128 CP -11.78 NEm -6.85)/ \\n(7.128 -0.0357 DEG) (calculated from Bur\\xad\\nroughs et al., 1975}, and \\nIP = 2CP -8.89 -(74.62 NEm -70.04 \\n-14.13 NE~)o .s (calculated \\nfrom Satter and Roffler, 1975}, \\nwhere IP is the percentage of intact dietary protein out \\nof which the DEG percentage of the protein is degraded \\nin the rumen. CP is the percentage protein required, \\nand NEm is in Meal per kilogram of dry diet. These rela\\xad\\ntionships can be used to determine the minimum \\namount of intact protein that can be fed when supple\\xad\\nmented with NPN. The difference between IP and CP is \\nthe amount of dietary protein that can be provided as \\nNPN. \\nThe amount of urea that can be included in the diet \\nfor the medium-frame beef steers of the example used \\npreviously was calculated assuming that 40 percent of \\nthe dietary protein was degraded in the rumen. If the \\nrequirement is 12.2 percent crude protein, and 40 per\\xad\\ncent of the intact protein fed is degraded in the rumen, \\nthe amount of intact protein needed is 10.3 and 11.8 \\npercent according to the two equations, respectively. \\nNPN could provide the difference ( 1. 9 or 1. 0 percentage \\nequivalents of protein), which is 0.68 or 0.37 percent \\nurea in the diet for this example.

Other than for common salt, animals \\napparently do not have the ability to select needed \\nminerals. \\nPresented in Table 5 are maximum tolerable levels \\n(NRC, 1980) of several elements that are known to be \\ntoxic to cattle. Maximum tolerable levels of these ele\\xad\\nments are influenced by a variety of dietary and animal \\nfactors. However, amounts of these elements in excess of \\nthe levels given are likely to result in adverse effects in \\ncattle. \\nCalcium \\nCalcium (Ca) is the most abundant mineral in the \\nbody. It is needed for bone formation, development of \\nteeth, production of milk, transmission of nerve im\\xad\\npulses, maintenance of normal muscle excitability \\n(along with sodium and potassium), regulation of heart\\xad\\nbeat, movement of muscles, blood clotting (conversion \\nof prothrombin to thrombin), and activation and stabi\\xad\\nlization of enzymes (i.e., pancreatic amylase). Most of \\nthe calcium in the body is found in the skeleton and \\nteeth, and these pools constitute approximately 2 per\\xad\\ncent of body weight. In blood, calcium is found mostly \\nin plasma, with a homeostatically controlled concentra\\xad\\ntion of about 10 mg/100 ml. \\nCalcium is absorbed actively from the duodenum and jejunum. The solubility of calcium compounds, and \\nhence the absorption of calcium, is favored by acid con\\xad\\nditions and hindered by alkaline conditions in the small \\nintestine. Thus, most calcium is absorbed in the proxi\\xad\\nmal portion of the duodenum. Calcium absorption is \\ndepressed by fluorine (Ramberg and Olson, 1970), is \\ngreater in young than old animals (Hansard et al., \\n1954), is greater during periods of low calcium intake \\nthan when calcium intake is high, and is depressed dur\\xad\\ning a lack of vitamin D (DeLuca, 1974). Strontium ab\\xad\\nsorption and metabolism parallel those of calcium \\n(Comar et al., 1961). \\nSeveral changes occur in response to a lowering of \\nplasma calcium. First, parathyroid hormone is released. \\nIt stimulates the production of 1 ,25-dihydroxy cholecal\\xad\\nciferol, a metabolically active form of vitamin D. The \\n1 ,25-dihydroxy cholecalciferol increases production of \\ncalcium-binding protein in the intestines, and in con\\xad\\njunction with the parathyroid hormone it increases cal\\xad\\ncium resorption from bone and increases phosphorus \\nloss in urine. \\nIf plasma calcium levels become elevated, calcitonin \\nis produced and parathyroid hormone production is in\\xad\\nhibited. Thus, calcium absorption and bone resorption \\nare slowed. The interplay of parathyroid hormone, thy\\xad\\nrocalcitonin, and 1,25-dihydroxy cholecalciferol main\\xad\\ntains plasma calcium within narrow limits. Therefore, \\nplasma calcium is usually inadequate as a measure of \\ncalcium status. \\nAt parturition, dairy cows exhibit a drop of 1 to 2 mg \\ncalcium/100 ml plasma calcium. Milk fever may de\\xad\\nvelop if plasma calcium drops below 5 mg/100 ml Oa\\xad\\ncobson et al., 1975). \\nCalcium is excreted mainly in feces with only small \\nquantities appearing in urine. The low urinary loss \\nis due to an effective reabsorption of calcium by the \\nkidney. \\nCalcium and phosphorus requirements for growing \\nand finishing cattle (Table 3) were calculated on the ba\\xad\\nsis of needs for maintenance plus those for production. \\nMaintenance requirements were calculated as 1.54 g of \\nretained calcium (Hansard et al., 1954, 1957) and 2.80 g \\nof retained phosphorus (Kleiber et al., 1951; Lofgreen \\nand Kleiber, 1953, 1954; Tillman and Brethour, 1958; \\nLofgreen et al., 1952) for each 100 kg of body weight. \\nRetained calcium and phosphorus needs above mainte\\xad\\nnance were calculated as 7.1 and 3.9 g, respectively, per \\n100 g of protein gain. The calcium and phosphorus con\\xad\\ntents of gains were calculated from data presented by \\nEllenberger et al. (1950). Calcium and phosphorus \\nneeds, above maintenance, during the first 3 to 4 \\nmonths of lactation were calculated as 1. 23 g of calcium \\nand 0.95 g of phosphorus per kilogram of milk produced \\n(NRC, 1978). Milk productions were assumed to be 5 or \", metadata={'source': '/content/19398.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",

Fetal calcium and phosphorus con\\xad\\ntents were assumed to be 13.7 and 7.6 g/kg fetal weight. \\nThis requirement was distributed over the last 3 months \\nof pregnancy. Average birth weight was assumed to be \\n30 kg. Total amounts of available calcium and phos\\xad\\nphorus for the various classes of cattle were calculated \\nby adding maintenance and production requirements. \\nThese values were converted to dietary calcium and \\nphosphorus requirements assuming a true digestibility \\nfor dietary calcium of 50 percent (Hansard et al., 1954, \\n1957) and a true digestibility for dietary phosphorus of \\n85 percent (Kleiber et al., 1951; Lofgreen and Kleiber, \\n1953, 1954). The calcium and phosphorus requirements \\ndetermined in this manner are in general agreement \\nwith those reported by Beeson et al. (1941), Mitchell \\n(1947), Wise et al. (1958), Wentworth and Smith \\n(1961), Baker (1964), Varner and Woods (1968, 1972), \\nand Ricketts et al. (1970). Reports by Call et al. (1978) \\nand Butcher et al. (1979) showed that diets that con\\xad\\ntained 0.14 percent phosphorus on an as-fed basis met \\nrequirements of beef cows. A diet that contained 0.09 \\npercent phosphorus resulted in reduced appetites after 8 \\nto 14 months. The 0.14 percent phosphorus diet would \\nprovide only slightly less phosphorus than determined \\nherein, since cattle in the report by Call et al. (1978) \\nweighed only 163 to 377 kg. \\nSince true digestibilities of calcium and phosphorus in \\nfeedstuffs vary, dietary calcium and phosphorus re\\xad\\nquirements shown in Tables 3 and 7 may in some in\\xad\\nstances need to be adjusted. Calcium requirements are \\ninfluenced by such animal factors as age, weight, and \\ntype and level of production. Young animals absorb cal\\xad\\ncium more efficiently than older animals (Hansard \\net al., 1957), but they have higher requirements because \\nof a higher rate of bone growth. Also, high rates of gain \\nor milk production, high-fat diets, and pregnancy in\\xad\\ncrease calcium requirements. The effect of calcium\\xad\\nphosphorus ratio on the performance of ruminants ap\\xad\\npears to have been overemphasized in the past. Several \\nstudies have shown that dietary calcium-phosphorus ra\\xad\\ntios between 1: 1 and 7: 1 result in near normal perfor\\xad\\nmance (Dowe et al., 1957; Wise et al., 1963; Smith et \\nal., 1966; Ricketts et al., 1970), providing that phos\\xad\\nphorus consumption meets requirements. \\nA deficiency of calcium results in rickets in young ani\\xad\\nmals and osteomalacia in older animals. Rickets may be \\ncaused by a deficiency of calcium, phosphorus, or vita\\xad\\nmin D. It is characterized by improper calcification of \\nthe organic matrix of bones of young, growing animals. \\nThus, the bones are weak, soft, and lack density. Signs \\ninclude swollen, tender joints; enlargement of the ends \\nof bones; an arched back; stiffness of the legs; and devel\\xad\\nopment of beads on the ribs. If the condition causing \\nrickets is not corrected, calves will develop bowed and Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 13 \\ndeformed legs, because of the effects of muscle tension \\nand weight on the weak, soft leg bones. Also, rachitic \\nbones are highly susceptible to fracture. \\nOsteomalacia is the result of demineralization of the \\nbones of adult animals. Since calcium and phosphorus \\nin bone are in a dynamic state, high metabolic demands \\non calcium and phosphorus stores, such as occur during \\npregnancy and lactation, may result in osteomalacia. \\nThis condition is characterized by weak, brittle bones \\nthat may break when stressed. Dairy cows that have lac\\xad\\ntated heavily and that have been fed insufficient cal\\xad\\ncium are prone to develop osteomalacia. \\nRuminants tolerate high levels of dietary calcium. \\nColovos et al. (1957) noted reduced protein and energy \\ndigestibilities in dairy heifers fed high levels of ground \\nlimestone. Calcium reduces the absorption of tetracy\\xad\\nclines, manganese, and zinc (Suttle and Field, 1970). \\nReduced feed consumption and daily gains may occur \\nwhen high-calcium diets are fed. A hypercalcemia as \\nthe result of excess calcium absorption stimulates the \\nproduction of calcitonin by the thyroid. Calcitonin in\\xad\\nhibits bone resorption. If high dietary levels of calcium \\nare maintained and the body remains under the influ\\xad\\nence of calcitonin, the cortex of bones may thicken (os\\xad\\nteopetrosis) because of continued deposition but limited \\nresorption. \\nThe calcium content of feedstuffs varies greatly. \\nSources of variation in calcium content include types of \\nplant, portion of plant fed, and stage of maturity. Cal\\xad\\ncium concentrations in forages generally decline with \\nmaturity. Legumes are high in calcium, and the cereal \\ngrains are low in calcium. Several of the oilseed meals \\nare good sources of calcium. Sources of supplemental \\ncalcium include calcium carbonate, ground limestone, \\nbone meal, dicalcium phosphate, defluorinated phos\\xad\\nphate, monocalcium phosphate, and calcium sulfate. \\nCobalt \\nThe cobalt (Co) requirement of cattle is actually a co\\xad\\nbalt requirement of rumen microorganisms. The mi\\xad\\ncrobes incorporate cobalt into vitamin B12, which is uti\\xad\\nlized by both microorganisms and animal tissues. \\nVitamin B12 (cobalamin) is of key importance in the uti\\xad\\nlization of propionic acid. The main physiological man\\xad\\nifestation of cobalt or B12 deficiency is impaired propio\\xad\\nnate metabolism, since it is needed for activity of \\nmethylmalonyl-CoA isomerase, an enzyme that cata\\xad\\nlyzes the converson of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl\\xad\\nCoA (Marston et al., 1961). Vitamin B12 is also a part of \\nthe enzyme 5-methyltetrahydrofolate:homocysteine \\nmethyltransferase (Cawthorne and Smith, 1974). This \\nenzyme catalyzes the recycling of methionine from \\nhomocysteine after the loss of its labile methyl group. ', metadata={'source': '/content/19398.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

However, cobalt stored in tissues does not \\nreadily pass to the rumen for synthesis of B12• The re\\xad\\nmainder of the body cobalt is distributed among other \\ntissues, with the kidney and liver containing the most \\ncobalt. Cobalt levels (dry basis) in kidney, liver, pan\\xad\\ncreas, spleen, and heart average 0.25, 0.15, 0.11, 0.09, \\nand 0.06 ppm, respectively. Whole blood contains \\nabout0.9 ngofvitamin B12/ml in calves and0.5 ng/ml in \\nmature cows (Smith and Loosli, 1957). \\nAbout 3 percent of ingested cobalt is converted to vi\\xad\\ntamin B12 in the rumen (Smith and Marston, 1970). Of \\nthe total vitamin B12 produced, only 1 to 3 percent is \\nabsorbed. The absorptive site is the lower portion of the \\nsmall intestine. Substantial amounts of B12 are secreted \\ninto the duodenum and then resorbed in the ileum. Co\\xad\\nbalt and vitamin B12 are mainly excreted in the feces, \\nalthough variable amounts are excreted in urine (Smith, \\n1965; Smith and Marston, 1970). \\nA cobalt concentration of 0.10 ppm in diet dry matter \\nis considered adequate for all cattle (Smith and Loosli, \\n1957). Other estimates range from 0.07 to 0.11 ppm in \\nthe dry matter (Underwood, 1977). Calves may be \\nslightly more sensitive to cobalt deficiency than mature \\ncattle. Cobalt-deficient soils occur in many parts of the \\nworld with large deficient areas in Australia, New \\nZealand, and along the southeast Atlantic coast of the \\nUnited States (Ammerman, 1970). Cattle grazing in \\nthese areas develop deficiency signs ranging from sub\\xad\\nclinical to acute. If cattle are confined to cobalt\\xad\\ndeficient pastures or diets, they appear normal for sev\\xad\\neral weeks or months, depending on age and degree of \\ndeficiency (Underwood, 1966). As body stores of vita\\xad\\nmin B12 are depleted, a gradual loss of appetite and body \\nweight occurs, followed by extreme anorexia, muscular \\nwasting, and severe anemia, culminating in death. In \\nsevere deficiency the mucous membranes become \\nblanched, the skin turns pale, a fatty liver develops, and \\nthe body becomes almost totally devoid of fat. Anemia \\ndevelops after anorexia occurs, which may be a result of \\npropionate accumulation. In extreme cobalt deficiency, \\nplasma glucose levels fall as a result of impaired pro\\xad\\npionate metabolism. Elevated plasma glutamic\\xad\\noxaloacetic transaminase and low ascorbic acid levels \\nreflect the severe liver damage. Plasma pyruvate levels \\nare high because of an induced thiamine deficiency. \\nA vitamin B12 level of less than 0.1 p.g/ g of fresh liver \\nis indicative of a moderate cobalt deficiency, with \\nlevels below 0.07 p.g/g indicative of severe deficiency \\n(Andrewset al., 1959). Plasma levels of about 0.2 ng/ml \\nare indicative of a cobalt deficiency, although there is considerable individual variability. The best indicators \\nof a cobalt deficiency are low plasma B12 levels, loss of \\nappetite, and elevated blood pyruvate. \\nCobalt toxicity in ruminants is rare because toxic lev\\xad\\nels are about 300 times requirement levels. Keener et al. \\n(1949) fed up to 110 mg/kg of body weight of cobalt \\ndaily to young dairy calves without harmful effects. \\nWhen calves were fed greater amounts, a mild poly\\xad\\ncythemia occurred. Other signs of excessive cobalt in\\xad\\ntake are excessive urination, defecation, and salivation; \\nshortness of breath; and increased hemoglobin, red cell \\ncount, and packed cell volume. Cobalt fed as sulfate, \\nchloride, or carbonate was shown to be equally toxic \\nwhen fed in excess (Keener et al., 1949). Methionine \\nmay aid in protecting against cobalt toxicity (Dunn \\net al., 1952). \\nLegumes are generally higher in cobalt than grasses, \\nalthough availability of cobalt in soil causes much vari\\xad\\nability. Alfalfa may vary from 0.09 to 0.56 ppm cobalt \\nin dry matter (NRC, 1978). Oilseed meals are generally \\ngood sources. Cereal grains, particularly corn, are poor, \\nwith concentrations of 0.01 to 0.06 ppm. Cobalt can be \\nadded to diets or mineral mixes as cobalt oxide or salts \\nsuch as cobalt sulfate and cobalt chloride. Cobalt sulfate \\nand cobalt oxide administered by drenching were \\nequally effective for lambs grazing cobalt-deficient pas\\xad\\ntures (Underwood, 1977). A cobalt pellet (composed of \\ncobalt oxide and finely divided iron) that lodges in the \\nreticulum has been successful in preventing deficiency \\nfor extended periods in cattle grazing deficient pastures. \\nCopper \\nCopper (Cu) is necessary for hemoglobin formation, \\niron absorption from the small intestine, and iron mobi\\xad\\nlization from tissue stores. Ceruloplasmin, which is syn\\xad\\nthesized in the liver and contains copper, is necessary for \\nthe oxidation of iron, permitting it to bind with the iron \\ntransport protein, transferrin. Copper is also essential in \\nconnective tissue metabolism. Lysyl oxidase, a copper\\xad\\ncontaining amine oxidase, is involved in the crosslinking \\nof polypeptide chains in elastin and collagen (Kim and \\nHill, 1966; Carnes, 1971). Other enzymes that contain \\nor require copper for biological activity include cyto\\xad\\nchrome oxidase, uricase, tyrosinase, glutathione oxi\\xad\\ndase, butyryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase, catylase, \\naminolevulinic acid hydrase, ascorbic acid oxidase, lac\\xad\\ncase, 13-mercaptopyruvate transulfurase, lecithinase, \\nand oxaloacetate decarboxylase. \\nNormal blood copper levels range from 70 to 170 p.g/ \\n100 ml in most ruminants (Beck, 1956). Cunningham \\n(1931) reported copper levels in liver, heart, lung, \\nspleen, and kidney from newborn calves of 470.0, 14.8, \\n4.9, 4.8, and 15.7 ppm in the dry matter of respective ', metadata={'source': '/content/19398.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",

Normal tissue copper levels vary with dietary \\nintake, species, age, and nutritional status. Hepatic cop\\xad\\nper concentrations in hypercupremic sheep and cattle \\nmay increase 10-fold over normal animals. These high \\nlevels of hepatic copper may cause the hemolytic crises \\nthat result in death of animals fed high levels of copper \\n(NRC, 1980). \\nCopper is absorbed from the upper portion of the du\\xad\\nodenum. In sheep, considerable absorption takes place \\nfrom the large intestine (Underwood, 1977). The extent \\nof absorption may be influenced by age, some hor\\xad\\nmones, pregnancy, and some diseases (Goodrich et al., \\n1972). Mills (1956, 1958) reported that the chemical \\nform of copper may influence its availability to animals \\nand that neutral or anionic organic copper complexes \\nappear to be more readily absorbed than copper sulfate. \\nAlso, several nutrient interrelationships have a pro\\xad\\nfound effect on the absorption of this element. \\nHill and Matrone (1970) noted that zinc and silver are \\nantagonistic to copper absorption. Histidine and other \\namino acids favor the absorption of several metals (cop\\xad\\nper, iron, zinc) because they prevent the formation of \\nmetal hydroxides and metal-phosphates that are poorly \\nabsorbed (Forth et al., 1973). \\nCopper excretion is an active process in which copper \\nis released into bile and ultimately into feces (Under\\xad\\nwood, 1977). Trace amounts of copper are excreted in \\nurine, perspiration, and milk. In cases of bile duct ob\\xad\\nstruction or Wilson\\'s disease (NRC, 1980), copper may \\nbe excreted in urine. \\nDiet concentrations of 4 to 10 ppm copper have gener\\xad\\nally been considered to meet requirements of beef cattle \\n(Goodrich et al., 1972). Diets with less than 3 to 5 ppm \\ncopper may result in subnormal plasma and liver copper \\nlevels in cattle. However, dietary levels of molybdenum \\nand inorganic sulfur may influence the amounts of cop\\xad\\nper required by ruminants. Goodrich and Tillman \\n( 1966) determined that supplemental molybdenum or \\nsulfur as sulfate decreased copper retention and storage \\nin livers of sheep. Calves fed milk diets for long periods, \\nolder cattle fed forages grown on copper-deficient soils, \\nand animals fed diets high in molybdenum and sulfate \\nmay develop copper deficiency signs (NRC, 1980). \\nGenerally, plasma copper levels below 60 p.g/100 ml \\nare indicative of copper deficiency in cattle. However, \\nthe first clinical sign of a hypocupremic condition is usu\\xad\\nally achromatrichia (lack of pigmentation). Low copper \\nintakes reduce the synthesis and activity of the copper\\xad\\ncontaining enzyme, tyrosinase, which is required for the \\nconversion of tyrosine to melanin. Tyrosinase is re\\xad\\nquired for pigmentation of hair, wool, and feathers \\n(Underwood, 1977). \\nAmine oxidase is responsible for the oxidation of the \\nepsilon-amino group of lysine, which is necessary for the Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 15 \\ncrosslinking of polypeptide chains of elastin and colla\\xad\\ngen. Underwood (1977) noted that hypocupremic ani\\xad\\nmals have decreased levels of amine oxidase and that this \\nfactor may predispose fibrosis of the myocardium, thin \\nbones with broadened epiphyseal cartilage, and low os\\xad\\nteoblastic activity in bones. Hypocupremic cattle and \\nsheep may develop spontaneous fractures or osteoporo\\xad\\nsis due to decreased crosslinking in collagen. Starcher \\net al. (1964) reported that hypocupremic chicks had de\\xad\\ncreased aortic elastin contents. Sheep that graze on cop\\xad\\nper-deficient soils may give birth to lambs having \\n\"swayback,\" which appears to be caused by cerebral de\\xad\\nmyelinization (Marston et al., 1948). \\nSoil concentrations of copper may vary considerably \\nby geographical location. In the United States, some \\nsoils have been found to contain more than 37 ppm of \\ncopper (Shacklette, 1970). Thus, plants grown in these \\nregions may have high copper contents (NRC, 1980). \\nAlso, curing or drying of forages may alter the chemical \\nform of copper, making it more available than copper in \\nfresh green plants (Underwood, 1977) and predisposing \\nanimals to copper poisoning. \\nCopper toxicity is initially characterized by increased \\nserum transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase activi\\xad\\nties. During the hemolytic crises, blood copper, methe\\xad\\nmoglobin, and creatine phosphokinase increase, while \\nlevels of hemoglobin and glutathione are depressed \\n(NRC, 1980). Hypercupremia in sheep promotes renal \\ntubular necrosis; spongy lesions in the white matter of \\nthe brain; dark, stained kidneys; and swollen livers \\n(NRC, 1980). In acute oral toxicity, animals may experi\\xad\\nence nausea, vomiting, salivation, abdominal pain, \\nconvulsions, paralysis, collapse, and death. Hypercu\\xad\\npremic conditions may also predispose the animal to \\nanemia, muscular dystrophy, decreased growth, and \\nimpaired reproduction (NRC, 1980). \\nMaximum tolerable dietary levels of copper during \\ngrowth, as recommended by the National Research \\nCouncil (1980), are 115 ppm for cattle. Maximum toler\\xad\\nable levels are greater for adults than for young, grow\\xad\\ning animals. \\nGrains are generally lower in copper than forages. \\nMost forages provide 3 or 4 times the copper require\\xad\\nment of beef cattle. Plants that contain high levels of \\nmolybdenum, sulfur, phytate, or lignin may reduce \\ncopper absorption (Underwood, 1977). In regions \\nwhere copper-deficient soils exist, if soil molybdenum \\nlevels are high or if plant sources of copper are in chemi\\xad\\ncal forms that are unavailable to the animal, copper \\nsupplementation may be necessary. Chapman and Bell \\n(1963) ranked inorganic forms of copper in decreasing \\norder of availability as CuC03, Cu(N03)2, CuS0 4, \\nCuCl2, Cu20, CuO (powder), CuO (needles), and Cu \\n(wire).

Inor\\xad\\nganic iodine is taken up by the thyroid gland for the syn\\xad\\nthesis of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones have an \\nactive role in thermoregulation, intermediary metabo\\xad\\nlism, reproduction, growth and development, circula\\xad\\ntion, and muscle function. Dietary organic iodine is de\\xad\\ngraded to more usable inorganic forms before being \\nabsorbed. In nonruminants, dietary inorganic iodine is \\nabsorbed along the gastrointestinal tract and trans\\xad\\nported by loose attachment to plasma proteins (Under\\xad\\nwood, 1977). In ruminants the rumen is the primary ab\\xad\\nsorption site, while the abomasum aids in excretion of \\niodine (Barua et al., 1964). After absorption, iodine is \\ndistributed throughout the body. Of a total of 50 mg of \\niodine in the human body, 10 to 15 mg are located in the \\nthyroid gland (Harper et al., 1979). \\nConcentrations of iodine in the thyroid vary with the \\namount of iodine intake, age, and gland activity. Iodine \\nstored in the thyroid exists in several forms: inorganic \\niodide, mono and diiodotyrosine, thyroxine, triiodothy\\xad\\nronine, and thyroglobulin. Eighty percent of hormonal \\niodine stored by the thyroid is thyroxine (T4}; the bal\\xad\\nance is in the form of transition products. Accumulation \\nof inorganic iodine and conversion of transition prod\\xad\\nucts to thyroxine is completed over a 48-hour period. \\nKidney and skeletal muscle also contain large propor\\xad\\ntions of total body iodine. In the female, iodine concen\\xad\\ntrations in ovaries are 3 to 4 times that of muscle (Gross, \\n1962). Small amounts of iodine found in bile, hair and \\nskin, stomach, and mammary glands act as storage sites \\nthat may endogenously supply the body with iodine \\nwhen the need exists. Two-thirds of ingested inorganic \\niodine is excreted by the kidney. The level of urinary \\niodine is positively correlated with plasma iodine con\\xad\\ncentration and dietary uptake. \\nMilk may also be considered a form of iodine secre\\xad\\ntion. The amount of iodine in milk is influenced by io\\xad\\ndine intake, season, level of milk production, and use of \\niodine disinfectants. Hemken et al. (1972) fed 0, 6.8, or \\n68 mg of potassium iodide daily to lactating dairy cows; \\nthe resulting milk contained 0.008, 0.081, and 0.694 \\nppm of iodine. Average iodine content of milk from 111 \\nherds was 0.646 ppm with a range of 0.04 to 4.84 ppm \\n(Hemken, 1978). High levels of iodine in milk are the \\nresult of either feeding high levels of dietary iodine or \\nuse of iodine as a sanitizing agent. Udder washes caused \\nthe iodine content of milk to increase by an average \\nof 0.035 ppm (Conrad and Hemken, 1975). Colo\\xad\\nstrum contains twice as much iodine as milk during \\nmidlactation. \\nDeficiencies of iodine may occur when animals con-sume feeds grown on iodine-deficient soils. In the \\nUnited States the Northwest and Great Lakes regions \\nare recognized as iodine-deficient areas. Samples of hay \\nfrom Maryland farms contained 1.31 to 2.54 ppm io\\xad\\ndine, while those from Illinois contained 0.62 to 1.02 \\nppm iodine (Hemken et al., 1972). Signs of an iodine \\ndeficiency include goiter, hairlessness in the young, re\\xad\\ntarded growth and maturity, lowered metabolic rate, \\nand increased water retention. In some cases the defi\\xad\\ncient condition does not originate from a deficient diet \\nbut is caused by the presence of dietary substances that \\naffect thyroid function and/or iodine uptake. Under\\xad\\nwood (1977) reported interrelationships that interfere \\nwith iodine metabolism as (1) thiocyanates, perchlo\\xad\\nrate, and rubidium salts; (2) high dietary arsenic, fluo\\xad\\nrine, or calcium levels; (3) deficient or high cobalt lev\\xad\\nels; and (4) low manganese intakes. Soybean meal and \\ncottonseed meal have both been shown to have goitro\\xad\\ngenic effects by increasing serum thyroxine losses to the \\nintestinal tract (Miller et al., 1972). \\nCattle requirements for iodine have not been exten\\xad\\nsively studied. The estimated iodine requirement for a \\n500-kg cow is about 1 mg per day. A normal diet for a \\nlactating cow provides 3.5 to 5 times this amount. \\nIodine toxicity has been studied in many animals. \\nSymptoms of iodine toxicity include anorexia, coma, \\ndeath, and necrosis of kidney, liver, and mucosal linings \\nof the gastrointestinaJ tract. \\nCalves with an initial weight of 100 kg were fed cal\\xad\\ncium iodate to provide dietary levels of 10 to 200 ppm \\niodine (Newton et al., 1974). Diets containing iodine in \\nexcess of 50 ppm depressed growth rate and feed intake. \\nCalves fed diets with added iodine had increased adre\\xad\\nnal weights, but no consistent iodine effect on the \\nweight of thyroid glands was observed. It was con\\xad\\ncluded that 50 ppm iodine was the minimum toxic level \\nfor calves. Yearling heifers suffered depressed daily \\ngains when fed a level of 435 ppm iodine, but additions \\nof 71, 140, or 283 ppm iodine to their diets had no effect \\non daily gains (Fish and Swanson, 1977). Lactating \\ncows fed diets with 200 ppm iodine [from ethylenedi\\xad\\namine dihydroiodide (EDDI)] for 49 weeks exhibited no \\nchanges in thyroid or pituitary function (Convey et al., \\n1977). Providing iodine, as EDDI, at levels of 2.5 mglkg \\nof body weight to pregnant cows had no effect on the \\ncow or her unborn calf. Levels of 5 to 7.5 mg/kg of body \\nweight increased the incidences of premature births and \\nweak and abnormal calves at birth and the number of \\nstillbirths. \\nFeed additives that supply iodine include calcium \\niodate, cuprous iodide, ethylenediamine dihydroio\\xad\\ndide, potassium iodate, potassium iodide, sodium \\niodate, sodium iodide, and pentacalcium periodate.

Biological availability of \\niodine supplements was reviewed by Ammerman and \\nMiller (1972) and Miller et al. (1975) studied metabo\\xad\\nlism of iodine from several sources. \\nIron \\nIron (Fe) has important biochemical functions in ani\\xad\\nmals since it is a component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, \\ncytochrome, and the enzymes catylase and peroxidase. \\nThe iron in these materials exists in porphyrin rings. Be\\xad\\ncause it is an integral part of these materials, iron is in\\xad\\nvolved in the transport of oxygen to cells as well as cellu\\xad\\nlar respiration. In cattle a majority of body iron is in the \\nform of hemoglobin, with lesser amounts existing as pro\\xad\\ntein-bound stored iron, myoglobin, and cytochrome. \\nThe spleen contains iron in high concentrations, with \\nlower levels found in the liver, kidney, and heart (Stand\\xad\\nish et al., 1969). \\nIron may be absorbed from all sections of the small \\nintestine, but the principal site of absorption is the duo\\xad\\ndenum. The percentage of dietary iron that is absorbed \\nis low in animals that have normal iron status but is in\\xad\\ncreased in animals deficient in iron. Ferrous iron is ab\\xad\\nsorbed to a much greater extent than ferric iron. Reduc\\xad\\ntion of ferric to ferrous iron occurs in the small intestine. \\nLoss of iron from the body is low and occurs in urine, \\nfeces, sweat, dermis, and blood (Dubach et al., 1955). \\nHemorrhage may represent a severe loss of iron and \\ngreatly increases the requirement. \\nIron requirements of ruminants are not well estab\\xad\\nlished. However, it is understood that young animals \\nhave higher iron requirements than adults. Based on re\\xad\\nsearch by Bremner and Dalgamo (1973) and Matrone \\net al. (1957) and the summary by the NRC (1978), the \\niron requirements of calves are thought to be about 100 \\nppm, while 50 ppm appears adequate for older cattle. \\nIron deficiencies are most likely to occur in young ani\\xad\\nmals (with high iron requirements) that are fed milk di\\xad\\nets (milk contains less than 10 ppm iron) and in animals \\nwith excessive blood loss. Signs of a lack of iron include \\nhypochromic microcytic anemia (reduced hemoglobin, \\nreduced packed cell volume), reduced saturation of \\ntransferrin, listlessness, pale mucus membranes, re\\xad\\nduced appetite and weight gain, and atrophy of the pa\\xad\\npillae of the tongue (Blaxter et al., 1957; Thomas, 1970; \\nBremner and Dalgamo, 1973). \\nIron toxicity is characterized by reduced feed intake \\nand reduced daily gain and by increased hemosiderin Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 17 \\ncontents of reticulo-endothelial cells and of parenchy\\xad\\nmal cells of liver, kidney, and spleen (siderosis). Diar\\xad\\nrhea, hypothermia, and metabolic acidosis are also ob\\xad\\nserved. Physiological lesions include vascular congestion \\nof liver, kidney, heart, lungs, brain, spleen, and gastro\\xad\\nintestinal tract (NRC, 1980). Minimum toxic levels of \\niron have been reported to be as low as 1000 ppm and as \\nhigh as 2500 ppm (Hartley et al., 1959; Standish et al., \\n1969, 1971; Koong et al., 1970; Standish and Ammer\\xad\\nman, 1971). An iron level of 1000 ppm is given by the \\nNRC (1980) as the maximum tolerable level for cattle. \\nThis is higher than the iron contents of most feedstuffs. \\nIron contents of common feeds are: forages, 100 to \\n500 ppm; cereal grains, 30 to 80 ppm; oilseed meals, 100 \\nto 400 ppm; meat and fish meals, 400 to 600 ppm; and \\ncalcium and phosphorus mineral supplements, 40 to \\n7000 ppm. Much of the variation in iron contents of \\nfeeds is likely due to contamination during manufacture \\nor sample preparation. Ammerman et al. (1967) ranked \\niron sources in decreasing order of availability, as fer\\xad\\nrous sulfate, ferrous carbonate, ferric chloride, and fer\\xad\\nric oxide. Thompson and Raven (1959) and Raven and \\nThompson (1959) reported that iron in grasses and le\\xad\\ngumes was less available than in ferric chloride. \\nMagnesium \\nMagnesium (Mg) is the fourth most abundant cation \\nin the body. It is required for skeletal development as a \\nconstituent of bone; it plays an important role in neuro\\xad\\nmuscular transmission and activity; and it is required to \\nactivate many enzyme systems by forming a metal\\xad\\nenzyme complex. Enzymes requiring magnesium in\\xad\\nclude those that split and transfer phosphate groups; this \\nincludes both phosphates and enzymes concerned in \\nreactions involving A TP. Since A TP is required in many \\nmetabolic reactions, it can be inferred that the action of \\nmagnesium also extends to these reactions. Magnesium \\nis also required as a cofactor in decarboxylation and an \\nactivator of many peptidases (Wacker and Vallee, \\n1964). \\nApproximately 65 percent of total body magnesium is \\ncontained in bone. One-third of magnesium in bone is \\ncombined with phosphorus, and the remainder is ad\\xad\\nsorbed loosely on the surface of the mineral structure. \\nThe remaining 35 percent is distributed among various \\ntissues and organs. Normal plasma magnesium levels \\nrange from 1.8 to 2.0 mg/100 ml (Underwood, 1966), \\nwith values below 1.0 to 1.2 mg/100 ml indicative of \\nmagnesium deficiency. \\nAbsorption of magnesium occurs prior to the intes\\xad\\ntines (Grace et al., 1974; Greene et al., 1983), from the \\nsmall intestine (Field, 1961) and some from the large ', metadata={'source': '/content/19398.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

However, urine is considered the major disposal \\nroute for magnesium absorbed in excess of requirements \\n(Rook et al., 1958). \\nMagnesium requirements of young calves have been \\nreported to range from 12 to 30 mg/kg body weight per \\nday (Huffman et al., 1941; Blaxter et al., 1954; Blaxter \\nand McGill, 1956). Data are limited regarding require\\xad\\nments for growing and finishing cattle; however, re\\xad\\nquirements are assumed to be similar to those for calves. \\nBeef cow requirements are between 7 and 9 g/ day dur\\xad\\ning gestation and 21, 22, and 18 g/day during early, \\nmid, and late lactation, respectively (O'Kelley and \\nFontenot, 1968, 1969). \\nMagnesium requirements may be increased by feed\\xad\\ning high levels of aluminum, potassium, phosphorus, or \\ncalcium, as these minerals decrease the efficiency of \\nmagnesium absorption and/or utilization (Wise et al., \\n1963; Newtonet al., 1972; Greeneet al., 1983). Age and \\nmagnesium status of cattle may alter requirements, \\nsince younger cattle and magnesium-deficient cattle ap\\xad\\npear to have more efficient magnesium absorption \\nmechanisms (Smith, 1962). Beef cows with high levels of \\nmilk production also have higher magnesium require\\xad\\nments (Blaxter and McGill, 1956). \\nDeficiences of magnesium may occur as a result of \\nsimple deficiencies, such as with young calves restricted \\nto milk diets (Blaxter et al., 1954; Blaxter and Rook, \\n1954); however, deficiencies are more frequently associ\\xad\\nated with the acute metabolic disorder hypomagnese\\xad\\nmic tetany, commonly referred to as grass tetany. Hypo\\xad\\nmagnesemic tetany is most likely to occur with beef \\ncows during initial stages of lactation while grazing pas\\xad\\ntures containing less than 0.2 percent magnesium (Un\\xad\\nderwood, 1966). Older cattle are probably more suscep\\xad\\ntible than younger cattle because of lowered labile \\nmagnesium stores and decreased absorption efficiency \\n(Smith, 1962; Thomas, 1965). \\nMagnesium-deficient cattle exhibit anorexia and re\\xad\\nduced dry matter digestibilities (Martin et al., 1964). \\nDeficiencies in young cattle may result in defective \\nbones and teeth. Initial signs of magnesium deficiency \\ninclude nervous apprehension, ears carried backwards, \\nstaring eyes, and an ataxic gait. As the deficiency be\\xad\\ncomes more severe, cattle become hypersensitive to tac\\xad\\ntile or sound stimuli, with muscle tremors occurring and \\nfinally giving way to convulsions. Death usually occurs \\nduring or after one of these convulsions. \\nActivities of many magnesium-dependent enzymes \\nare depressed during magnesium deficiency (Moore \\net al., 1938; Tufts and Greenberg, 1938; Elin et al., \\n1971). Subnormal levels of blood magnesium are com\\xad\\nmon, and clinical signs of tetany usually occur when blood levels drop to 1.0 and 1.2 mg/100 ml (Under\\xad\\nwood, 1966). Tissuelevelsofpotassiumdecline, andcal\\xad\\ncium and sodium may rise in magnesium-deficient ani\\xad\\nmals. \\nMagnesium toxicity does not occur in cattle fed typi\\xad\\ncal rations. Supplemental levels of magnesium up to 114 \\ng/ day have been fed without affecting cattle; however, \\nlevels of 170 to 350 g have resulted in deleterious effects \\n(Care, 1960). Maximal tolerable levels have been estab\\xad\\nlished as 0.4 percent of the ration by the NRC (1980). \\nFeeding toxic levels has resulted in anorexia, reduced \\nperformance, and occasional diarrhea (Pierce, 1959). \\nCattle experiencing toxicity may also exhibit lack of re\\xad\\nflexes and respiration depression. Plasma and urinary \\nmagnesium levels are highly correlated with magne\\xad\\nsium intake (above requirements) and are useful in de\\xad\\ntecting toxicity . \\nCommonly used feedstuffs vary widely in magnesium \\nconcentration and availability. Magnesium contents of \\nmost cereal grains are between 0.12 and 0.18 percent. \\nProtein supplements of animal origin are low in magne\\xad\\nsium, while those of plant origin usually contain 0.3 to \\n0.6 percent. Magnesium contents of herbage plants vary \\ngreatly and are normally higher in legumes than grasses. \\nMagnesium fertilization usually increases plant magne\\xad\\nsium content. Also, magnesium availability increases \\nwith increasing plant maturity (Underwood, 1966). \\nSeveral sources of inorganic magnesium may be used \\nto supplement cattle. Magnesium carbonate, oxide, and \\nsulfate are considered good sources of supplemental \\nmagnesium; however, magnesium from magnesite and \\ndolomitic limestone is not readily available to cattle \\n(Gerken and Fontenot, 1967; Ammerman and Chicco, \\n1968). \\nManganese \\nManganese (Mn) is nutritionally essential for both \\nplants and animals. Deficiencies of manganese lead to \\ndegenerative reproductive failure in both males and fe\\xad\\nmales, bone malformations and crippling, ataxia, de\\xad\\npigmentation, and deterioration of the central nervous \\nsystem. Manganese is a preferred metal cofactor for \\nmany enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism \\nand in mucopolysaccharide synthesis. Manganese en\\xad\\nzyme systems include glycosyltransferase, pyruvate car\\xad\\nboxylase, GTP oxaloacetate carboxylase, isocitrate \\ndehydrogenase, malic dehydrogenase, arginine synthe\\xad\\ntase, and glutamine synthetase. A large number of en\\xad\\nzyme systems that require magnesium can utilize man\\xad\\nganese.

The glandular organs that are most sensi\\xad\\ntive to manganese status are liver, kidney, pancreas, and \\npituitary, and they exhibit the highest manganese con\\xad\\ntent, with a measureable amount found in bone (Hi\\xad\\ndiroglou, 1979). The liver contains important mobiliz\\xad\\nable manganese stores. Bentley and Phillips (1951) \\nmeasured liver stores of manganese at 12 ppm (DM ba\\xad\\nsis) when cattle were fed dietary manganese at 30 ppm. \\nRuminants regulate manganese levels in blood and \\ntissues via homeostatic control of intestinal absorption. \\nManganese is excreted via feces, with little in urine. Ber\\xad\\ntinchamps et al. ( 1966) concluded that bile was the prin\\xad\\ncipal route of manganese excretion. Phosphorus, cal\\xad\\ncium, iron, zinc, copper, magnesium, and molybdenum \\nhave been implicated as interacting with manganese. \\nWork by Hidiroglou et al. (1978) and Lassiter et al. \\n( 1972) suggests a calcium-phosphorus-manganese inter\\xad\\naction. \\nRequirements for manganese are increased by ele\\xad\\nvated dietary levels of calcium and phosphorus \\n(Hawkins et al., 1955; Lassiter et al., 1972}; thus, estab\\xad\\nlishment of a single requirement value is difficult and \\nmay be misleading. Also, only limited information is \\navailable concerning manganese requirements of rumi\\xad\\nnants. Mature females have higher requirements for \\nmanganese than feedlot cattle because of an increased \\nneed for reproduction and fetal development (Bentley \\nand Phillips, 1951; Rojaset al., 1965). Dyeret al. (1964) \\nnoted that cows fed diets with 56 ppm of manganese had \\nnormal calves, but those fed diets with 47 ppm manga\\xad\\nnese and a high level of calcium gave birth to deformed \\ncalves. The manganese requirement of 40 ppm given by \\nHidiroglou (1979) and the NRC (1978) should be ade\\xad\\nquate for normal reproduction, but 20 ppm is likely to \\nbe adequate for growing-finishing cattle (Underwood, \\n1977). \\nHidiroglou et al. (1978) listed the average plasma \\nmanganese value for cattle as 25 ng/ml. According to \\nLeach (1971), there are at least two manganese-depen\\xad\\ndent enzyme systems that are severely affected by man\\xad\\nganese deficiency, resulting in skeletal and postural \\ndefects. These are the polymerase system, which is re\\xad\\nsponsible for chain elongation of polysaccharides, and \\nthe galatosyltransferase system, which links protein \\nmolecules with polysaccharides. Chondroitin sulfate is \\nthe mucopolysaccharide most severely affected by a lack \\nof manganese, thus affecting synthesis of bone connec\\xad\\ntive tissue. \\nImpairment of reproductive function in males and fe\\xad\\nmales occurs during manganese deficiency. Along with \\nimpaired spermatogenesis (Underwood, 1977), irregu\\xad\\nlar or absent estrus, and delayed conception, Utter \\n(1976) and Hidiroglou et al. (1978) noted that manga-Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 19 \\nnese is known to be an activator of numerous enzymes, \\nincluding hydrolases, kinases, decarboxylases, and \\ntransferases. Inhibition of these enzyme systems could \\nresult in insufficient material for fetal growth and, \\ntherefore, may contribute to abortion and deformities. \\nHidiroglou and Shearer (1976) reported a high manga\\xad\\nnese content of corpora lutea, suggesting another possi\\xad\\nble role for manganese in normal reproduction. For \\nmales, manganese deficiency is demonstrated by im\\xad\\npaired spermatogenesis; testicular and epididymal de\\xad\\ngeneration; sex hormone inadequacy; and, eventually, \\nsterility. \\nFor ruminants, manganese is among the least toxic of \\nthe required minerals. There are few documented tox\\xad\\nicities. At 125 ppm manganese, hemoglobin levels are \\ndepressed, and anemia occurs in growing pigs. Sup\\xad\\nplementation with iron overcomes the hemoglobin \\ndepression at 125 ppm manganese. When 1250 ppm \\nmanganese was fed, growth of pigs was irreversibly de\\xad\\npressed (Matrone et al., 1959). The manganese-iron an\\xad\\ntagonism also is suggested to occur in cattle. \\nRuminants fed diets with 1000 ppm manganese have \\nnear normal growth rates and feed intakes and do not \\nexhibit obvious indications of toxicity. Cunningham \\net al. (1966) noted a significant depression in blood he\\xad\\nmoglobin as levels of a dietary manganese were elevated \\nabove 1000 ppm. The NRC (1980) states that with a bal\\xad\\nanced diet about 1000 ppm is the maximal tolerable \\nlevel on a short-term basis for sheep and cattle, with \\nabout 2000 ppm the maximum level for poultry and \\nonly 400 ppm for swine. \\nManganese levels in pastures, grains, and forages are \\nvariable because of variations in plant species, soil \\ntypes, soil pH, and fertilization practices. Forages con\\xad\\ntain high levels of manganese, with a grass-legume for\\xad\\nage approaching levels of 100 ppm (DM basis), while \\nsuch grains as corn, barley, and oats contain from 15 to \\n40 ppm manganese (Redshaw et al., 1978; Hidiroglou, \\n1979). \\nMolybdenum \\nMolybdenum (Mo) is found in nearly all body cells \\nand fluids, but its essentiality is due to its biochemical \\nrole in the enzymes xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, \\nand sulfide oxidase.

Molybdenum contents of soft tissue, blood, and \\nmilk are affected by molybdenum intake and are also \\ngreatly affected by copper and sulfur intakes. \\nHexavalent molybdenum, such as that in sodium and \\nammonium molybdates, is well absorbed by cattle. Mo\\xad\\nlybdenum in forages also is readily absorbed and may \\ninterfere with copper metabolism in cattle. The molyb\\xad\\ndenum from dried forage may not be as available as that \\nfrom green forage, since forages that interfere with cop\\xad\\nper metabolism when grazed do not cause difficulties \\nwhen fed as dry forage. Absorption of molybdenum is \\nfrom the intestine, and excretion of molybdenum is pri\\xad\\nmarily via urine, with small amounts excreted in bile \\nand milk. \\nRequirements for molybdenum are not established. \\nAn exact estimate of the molybdenum requirement is \\nimpossible since copper and sulfate alter molybdenum \\nmetabolism. Furthermore, the majority of research on \\nmolybdenum has concentrated on the interrelationship \\nwith copper and sulfate, rather than on a specific re\\xad\\nquirement. Ward (1978) speculated that there is no safe \\ndietary level of molybdenum because of such interac\\xad\\ntions. Work by Ellis et al. (1958) with growing lambs \\nshowed faster gains when dietary molybdenum was in\\xad\\ncreased from 0.36 to 2.37 ppm. \\nMolybdenum and sulfur both interfere with copper \\nmetabolism, and several mechanisms have been pro\\xad\\nposed to explain these interrelationships. Dowdy and \\nMatrone (1968a,b) used sheep, pigs, and chickens to \\nsubstantiate the existence of a copper-molybdenum \\ncomplex and to verify the antagonistic action of molyb\\xad\\ndenum on copper metabolism. These workers con\\xad\\ncluded that excess molybdenum may cause a copper de\\xad\\nficiency as a result of the formation of absorbable, but \\nmetabolically unavailable, copper-molybdate complex. \\nThe molar ratio of copper to molybdenum in the com\\xad\\nplex was about 4:3. The complex formed optimally at a \\nneutral pH and contained no sulfur. This complex may \\nexplain certain instances where plasma copper levels \\nhave been normal but where copper deficiency signs \\nhave been observed. \\nSulfur, in the absence of molybdenum, also may cause \\na copper deficiency because of the formation of insoluble, \\nunabsorbed copper sulfide in the gut. Rumen microor\\xad\\nganisms rapidly convert sulfate and other sulfur-contain\\xad\\ning compounds to sulfide, providing conditions favorable \\nfor the formation of unavailable copper sulfide. \\nSulfide also may be absorbed and form copper sulfide \\nin the body. Sulfide oxidase, an enzyme that liberates \\ncopper from copper sulfide, is inhibited by molybde\\xad\\nnum. Thus, molybdenum may contribute to a copper \\ndeficiency by preventing the liberation of copper from copper sulfide in the body. Plasma copper levels would \\nremain normal, but the animal would be copper defi\\xad\\ncient. \\nThe combined effects of dietary sulfur and molybde\\xad\\nnum on copper status are synergistic. This may be due to \\nthe formation of unabsorbable copper thiomolybdate \\n(Huisingh et al., 1973; Dick et al., 1975; Suttle, 1975). \\nThe formation of copper sulfide and copper thiomolyb\\xad\\ndate would greatly reduce copper absorption, since both \\nrender copper unavailable. Thus, plasma and liver cop\\xad\\nper levels are reduced and symptoms of copper defi\\xad\\nciency develop. Likewise, blood levels of molybdenum \\ndecline and fecal excretion increases. The formation of \\ncopper sulfide, copper molybdate, and copper thiomo\\xad\\nlybdate (one or more of which may occur under specific \\nconditions) can explain most observations of the copper\\xad\\nsulfur-molybdenum interrelationship. The formation of \\ncopper sulfide and copper thiomolybdate in the diges\\xad\\ntive tract explains those instances where molybdenum \\nor molybdenum and sulfur caused decreased absorption \\nof copper and decreased blood and liver copper. Forma\\xad\\ntion of copper molybdate, which is absorbed but not uti\\xad\\nlized, explains those instances where blood copper levels \\nare elevated and liver copper remains normal but the \\nanimal exhibits signs of copper deficiency. \\nClinical signs of molybdenum toxicity in cattle are di\\xad\\narrhea, anorexia, anemia, ataxia, and bone malforma\\xad\\ntion. Depigmentation of skin and hair, with a loss of \\ncrimp in wool, are the clinical signs exhibited by sheep. \\nSigns of molybdenosis are similar to those of a copper \\ndeficiency. \\nMolybdenum levels of 5 to 6 ppm inhibit copper stor\\xad\\nage and produce signs of molybdenosis (NRC, 1980). El\\xad\\nevated dietary copper alleviates the toxic effects of mo\\xad\\nlybdenum (Ferguson et al., 1943; Miller and Engel, \\n1960; Mills, 1960; Ward, 1978). When added to experi\\xad\\nmental diets, molybdenum has been supplied as sodium \\nor ammonium molybdate. \\nPhosphorus \\nPhosphorus (P) has varied, but extremely important, \\nbiochemical and physiological roles.

Erythrocytes contain much more phos\\xad\\nphorus than does plasma; thus, whole blood contains 6 \\nto 8 times as much phosphorus as does plasma. A major \\nfraction of total body phosphorus is found in bone. Phos\\xad\\nphorus is also found in high concentrations in brain, \\nmuscle, liver, spleen, and kidneys. \\nLike calcium, phosphorus absorption is an active pro\\xad\\ncess. Sodium may be required for the absorption of \\nphosphorus (Taylor, 1974), and the process is stimu\\xad\\nlated by 1,25-dihydroxy cholecalciferol (Chen et al., \\n1974). The amount of phosphorus absorbed is depen\\xad\\ndent on source, intestinal pH, age of the animal, and \\ndietary levels of calcium, iron, aluminum, manganese, \\npotassium, magnesium, and fat (Irving, 1964). Excess \\nphosphorus is excreted primarily in the feces. \\nMethods employed to establish phosphorus require\\xad\\nments and discussion of these values relative to pub\\xad\\nlished data are presented in the Calcium section earlier \\nin this chapter. \\nHigh iron levels result in the formation of insoluble \\niron phosphate, resulting in low phosphorus rickets (U n\\xad\\nderwood , 1977). Aluminum also forms insoluble, un\\xad\\navailable phosphates . \\nBecause many forages contain inadequate levels of \\nphosphorus to meet the requirements of growing or lac\\xad\\ntating cattle (Black et al., 1943), and because phos\\xad\\nphorus-deficient soils are common, phosphorus defi\\xad\\nciencies in cattle are widespread. Also, mature forages \\nand crop residues generally contain low levels of phos\\xad\\nphorus (Maynard et al., 1935), while the cereal grains \\nand oilseed meals contain moderate to high levels of \\nphosphorus . A deficiency of phosphorus results in de\\xad\\ncreased growth rates, inefficient feed utilization, and a \\ndepraved appetite (chewing of wood, soil and bones, a \\ncondition termed pica). Anestrus, low conception rate, \\nand reduced milk production are frequently associated \\nwith low-phosphorus diets. However, Teleni et al. \\n(1977) suggested that reproductive difficulties in beef \\ncows may be more related to protein intake. Plasma \\nphosphorus levels decline during phosphorus deficien\\xad\\ncies. Phosphorus-deficient animals may have weak, \\nfragile bones and become stiff in the joints (Preston et \\nal., 1977). \\nHigh phosphorus intakes may cause bone resorption, \\nelevated plasma phosphorus levels, and urinary calculi \\nas a result of precipitation of calcium and magnesium \\nphosphates in the kidney. Feeding increased amounts of \\ncalcium may reduce the incidence of urinary calculi in \\nanimals fed high phosphorus diets (Emerick and Em\\xad\\nbry, 1963, 1964). \\nIn a review of availabilities to ruminants of phos\\xad\\nphorus compounds, Peeler (1972) ranked availabilities \\nof common sources of phosphorus as follows: dicalcium Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 21 \\nphosphate, defluorinated phosphate and bone meal, \\nand soft phosphate. Sodium phosphates and ammonium \\npolyphosphate are approximately equal to dicalcium \\nphosphate in phosphorus availability. Orthophosphates \\nare more available than meta and pyrophosphates.

Phytate phos\\xad\\nphorus is not well utilized by nonruminants, but rumi\\xad\\nnants appear to use-considerable quantities of this form \\nof phosphorus (McGillivray, 1974). \\nPotassium \\nPotassium (K) is the third most abundant mineral ele\\xad\\nment in the animal body and the principal cation of in\\xad\\ntracellular fluid; it also is a constituent of extracellular \\nfluid, where it influences muscle activity. Red blood \\ncells contain approximately 25 times as much potassium \\nas is present in plasma. Muscle and nerve cells also are \\nhigh in potassium, containing over 20 times that present \\nin interstitial fluids. \\nThe concentration of potassium in the fat-free body of \\nadult cattle is 78 mEq/kg (Wilde, 1962). Serum potas\\xad\\nsium concentrations in cattle are about 4. 7 mEq/1 (Welt \\net al., 1960). \\nSeveral studies have been conducted to determine po\\xad\\ntassium requirements of cattle. Variable values have \\nbeen reported: the discrepancies possibly depend on \\namounts needed for only maintenance or for mainte\\xad\\nnance plus optimum growth or to effects of potassium on \\ndigestive function. Roberts and St. Orner (1965) con\\xad\\ncluded that the dietary potassium requirement of finish\\xad\\ning steers was between 0.5 and 0.6 percent of the ration. \\nA low potassium basal ration (0.08 percent potassium) \\nwas supplemented with K2C03 to provide rations con\\xad\\ntaining 0.36, 0.50, 0.67, or 0.77 percent potassium \\n(Devlin et al., 1969). This trial indicated that the potas\\xad\\nsium requirement for finishing steers was higher than \\n0.51 percent but not above 0. 72 percent of the diet. \\nClanton (1980) suggested that the potassium require\\xad\\nment of pregnant beef cows is between 0.5 and 0. 7 per\\xad\\ncent.

If extracellular potassium is increased \\nfrom 5 to 10 mEq/1, toxicity may result (Wilde, 1962). \\nAfter periods of moderately high potassium intake, ani\\xad\\nmals can survive potassium intakes that would other\\xad\\nwise be lethal (Wright et al., 1971). High dietary levels \\nof potassium interfere with magnesium absorption in \\nruminants and can cause hypomagnesemic tetany in \\nsheep (Newton et al., 1972; Fontenot et al., 1973). In\\xad\\ncreasing the potassium level in a liquid diet from 1.2 to \\n5.8 percent, dry basis, resulted in the death of 3 of 8 \\ncalves (Blaxter et al., 1960). Jackson et al. (1971) noted \\nreduced weight gains as the potassium contents of diets \\nfor lambs were increased from 0.7 to 3.0 percent. The \\nclinical signs before death were cardiac insufficiency, \\nedema, muscular weakness, and loss of muscular tone. \\nNo abnormalities in magnesium metabolism were ob\\xad\\nserved. Increasing dietary magnesium levels may offer \\nprotection against potassium toxicity. \\nLivestock needs for potassium vary with amounts of \\nprotein, phosphorus, calcium, and sodium consumed. \\nForage crops are high in potassium, even though their \\npotassium contents depend on the fertility of the soil in \\nwhich they are grown. Diets based largely on milo, \\ncorn, or corn and cob meal, together with low-potas\\xad\\nsium hays and silages, may fall short in providing suffi\\xad\\ncient potassium for fast-growing or high-producing ani\\xad\\nmals. Most high-protein feeds contain high levels of \\npotassium. Also, Clanton (1980) has shown that beef \\ncows grazing standing forage during winter months \\nmay be deficient in potassium. The most common \\nsource of supplemental potassium is KCl. \\nSelenium \\nSelenium (Se) is similar to sulfur in its chemical prop\\xad\\nerties. Interest in the biological significance of selenium \\nwas initially confined to the problem of toxicity in ani\\xad\\nmals (Underwood, 1971; Ullrey, 1973). \\nIn 1973, glutathione peroxidase was shown to be a \\nseleno enzyme (Rotruck et al., 1973); it contains four \\nselenium atoms (Briggs and Calloway, 1979). Sulfur\\xad\\ncontaining amino acids serve as precursors for glu\\xad\\ntathione and are therefore necessary for proper \\nglutathione peroxidase function (Burk, 1976). It is pos\\xad\\ntulated that glutathione peroxidase prevents membrane \\ndamage because of its antioxidant property (Hoekstra, 1973). Any postulates concerning the biochemical role \\nof selenium must consider the interrelationship between \\nselenium and vitamin E (Hoekstra, 1973). It has been \\nconclusively shown that selenium cannot be completely \\nreplaced by vitamin E, but their functions intertwine to \\naccount for their mutual sparing effect. Selenium is also \\neffective in reducing cadmium and mercury toxicity \\n(Parizek et al., 1973). \\nAbsorbed selenium is carried in the plasma (associ\\xad\\nated with protein) until it enters tissues (Moxon and \\nRhian, 1943; Herrman and McConnell, 1973). Sele\\xad\\nnium is excreted in feces and urine; however, fecal ex\\xad\\ncretion is greater than urinary excretion in ruminants \\n(McConnell, 1941; Underwood, 1971). Pulmonary ex\\xad\\ncretion of selenium is an important excretory route \\nwhen dietary intakes are high (McConnell, 1942; \\nMcConnell and Portman, 1952; Ganther et al., •1966); \\nhowever, it is insignificant, at least in the rat, when di\\xad\\netary selenium is less than 1 ppm (Burket al., 1972). \\nThe selenium requirement of beef cattle depends on \\nthe amount of vitamin E in the diet, but ranges are sug\\xad\\ngested as follows: growing and finishing steers and heif\\xad\\ners, 0.10 mg/kg dry weight diet; breeding bulls and \\npregnant and lactating cows, 0.05 to 0.10 mg/kg dry \\nweight diet. The NRC ( 1980) suggested that 0.10 to 0.30 \\nmg/kg dry weight of diet met requirements and that \\n2 mg/kg dry weight diet is the maximum tolerable level \\nfor all species. \\nMinimum requirements of animals vary with the \\nform of selenium ingested and the nature of the diet, \\nespecially vitamin E content (Underwood, 1971). Sele\\xad\\nnium is found associated with dietary protein as sele\\xad\\nnoamino acids in plants (Olson et al., 1970). Selenium in \\nanimal feeds is highly variable primarily due to the sele\\xad\\nnium status of the soil (Underwood, 1971). The plant \\nspecies Astragalus and Stanleya, selenium accumulators \\nthat grow mainly in seleniferous areas, can contain be\\xad\\ntween 1000 and 3000 ppm selenium. Thus, grazing live\\xad\\nstock may be adversely affected (Underwood, 1971; \\nBriggs and Calloway, 1979). \\nWhite muscle disease, a selenium-responsive myopa\\xad\\nthy, is characterized by white muscle, heart failure, and \\nparalysis (lameness, to an inability to stand) (Whanger \\net al., 1973). It is a muscular dystrophy that cannot be \\nproduced in calves on vitamin E-free diets unless the di\\xad\\nets are high in unsaturated fats (Muth et al., 1958; \\nHartley and Grant, 1961). Depression of glutathione \\nperoxidase in tissues of selenium-deficient animals may \\naccount for many of the manifestations of selenium defi\\xad\\nciency. \\nSelenium was identified as a toxicant in studies begun \\nin 1929 (Franke, 1934). General signs of toxicity include \\nloss of appetite, loss of tail hair, sloughing of hoofs, and ', metadata={'source': '/content/19398.pdf', 'page': 28}),\n",

Death is the result of respi\\xad\\nratory failure along with starvation and thirst. Two \\ntypes of selenium poisoning have been observed: acute, \\n\"blind staggers\"; and chronic, \"alkali disease\" (Rosen\\xad\\nfeld and Beath, 1964). Toxicity varies with the amounts \\nand chemical form of selenium ingested, the duration \\nand continuity of intake, and the nature of the diet (Un\\xad\\nderwood, 1971). Edible herbage in seleniferous areas \\ncontains 5 to 20 ppm (Underwood, 1971). Tissue levels \\nincrease with toxic intakes to a point; then excretion be\\xad\\ngins to keep pace with absorption and further accumu\\xad\\nlation does not occur (Underwood, 1971). High-protein \\ndiets and arsenic also appear to offer some protection \\n(Levander and Baumann, 1966; Underwood, 1971) \\nagainst high selenium intakes. \\nSodium and Chlorine \\nSodium (Na) functions in maintaining osmotic pres\\xad\\nsure, acid-base balance, and body-fluid balance. This \\ncation is also involved in nerve transmission and active \\ntransport of amino acids. Sodium is required for cellular \\nuptake of glucose through activation of the glucose car\\xad\\nrier protein. Chlorine (Cl) is necessary for the activation \\nof amylase and is essential for formation of gastric hy\\xad\\ndrochloric acid. In respiration and regulation of blood \\npH, chlorine is transferred between plasma and eryth\\xad\\nrocytes through a process known as the chloride shift. \\nSodium is the major cation of extracellular fluid and \\nprovides a majority of the alkaline reserve in plasma. \\nThe sodium content of plasma is normally 140 mEq/1. \\nMuch of the body\\'s sodium is incorporated into crystals \\nin bone, where it is not released until bone is resorbed. \\nThus, this fraction may serve as a slowly available so\\xad\\ndium pool. \\nChlorine is usually studied with sodium, as it is the \\nmajor anion of the extracellular fluid. Plasma chlorine \\nconcentration is normally 107 mEq/1, which is slightly \\nless than sodium concentration. Less than 15 percent of \\nbody chlorine is found within cells. \\nSodium and chlorine are mainly absorbed from the \\nproximal portion of the small intestine, but they may \\nalso be absorbed from the distal section of the small in\\xad\\ntestine and the large intestine. Some absorption of so\\xad\\ndium and chlorine may occur from the rumen. \\nCarnivorous animals usually secure adequate sodium \\nand chlorine in their diets. However, herbivores require \\nsupplementation, because plant materials are usually \\nlow in sodium and high in potassium. Potassium may \\npromote sodium excretion (Hafez and Dyer, 1969). \\nIn domestic animals, deficiencies of sodium and chlo\\xad\\nrine may occur because plants have low-sodium con\\xad\\ntents, because sodium losses caused by perspiration may Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 23 \\noccur in animals maintained in warm environments or \\nused for hard work, and because sodium needs increase \\nduring lactation and during periods of rapid growth \\n(Hafez and Dyer, 1969; Underwood, 1970). \\nSodium requirements are generally met by supple\\xad\\nmental sodium chloride. It is readily available and is \\nlow in cost. This, in part, may account for the lack of \\npublished requirements for chlorine in beef cattle. So\\xad\\ndium concentrations of 0.06 to 0.08 percent of diet dry \\nmatter for nonlactating yearlings and calves and no \\nmore than 0.1 percent dry matter for lactating beef cows \\n(Morris and Gartner, 1971; Morris and Murphy, 1972; \\nMorris, 1980) have been found to meet requirements. \\nBurkhaltor et al. (1979) reported that young bulls fed \\ndiets with 0.038 percent chlorine had gains and intakes \\nthat were similar to those for young bulls fed diets that \\ncontained 0.5 percent chlorine. \\nAnimals can be maintained for some time on low\\xad\\nsodium diets because of their efficient conservation \\nmechanisms. In severe deficiencies, animals may experi\\xad\\nence muscle cramps and a craving for salt that is evident \\nthrough constant licking, general weakness, and death \\n(Hafez and Dyer, 1969). Other signs may include \\nweight loss, decrease in milk production, and rough hair \\ncoat (Underwood, 1970). \\nMost animals can tolerate large quantities of dietary \\nsalt when an adequate supply of water is available \\n(NRC, 1980). More dramatic effects of sodium toxicosis \\nmay occur if the animal\\'s water is contaminated with \\ndissolved salts. Addition of sodium chloride to drinking \\nwater to give 12 to 20 g/1 caused anorexia, decreased \\nwater consumption, weight loss, elevated plasma potas\\xad\\nsium and sodium concentrations, depressed plasma \\nmagnesium and urea levels, and physical collapse in cat\\xad\\ntle (Weeth et al., 1960; Weeth and Haverland, 1961). \\nMuch of the western half of the United States, and \\nmany other semiarid regions, have soils that are high in \\nsalinity and saline groundwater, which may lead to sa\\xad\\nline water intoxication. Clinical signs follow consump\\xad\\ntion of water that has more than 7000 ppm of dissolved \\nsalt and include low consumption of feed and water, \\nmild digestive disturbances, low rates of gain, and diar\\xad\\nrhea Qensen and Mackey, 1979). \\nSodium and chlorine are widely distributed in na\\xad\\nture; however, feedstuffs used in livestock production \\ncontain insufficient salt to meet requirements.

Amino acid derivatives that contain sulfur include \\ncystathionine, taurine, and cysteic acid. Methionine is a \\nkey amino acid, since all other sulfur compounds, except \\nthe B-vitamins thiamine and biotin, that are necessary \\nfor normal body function can be synthesized from me\\xad\\nthionine. Body functions that involve sulfur include \\nprotein synthesis and metabolism, fat and carbohydrate \\nmetabolism, blood clotting, endocrine function, and \\nintra-and extracellular fluid acid-base balance (Baker, \\n1977). \\nSulfur has both structural and metabolic functions; \\nthus, it is found in virtually every tissue and organ of the \\nbody. Masters and McCance (1939) showed that muscle \\nhas a fairly constant nitrogen to sulfur ratio of 15.3:1. \\nThe total body content of sulfur is approximately 0.15 \\npercent. \\nThe microbial population of the rumen has the ability \\nto convert inorganic sulfur into organic sulfur com\\xad\\npounds that can be utilized by the animal. Block et al. \\n(1951) concluded that sodium sulfate was converted in \\nthe rumen to cystine and methionine and then incorpo\\xad\\nrated into microbial protein. The use of elemental sulfur \\nby microbes has been demonstrated by Saville et al. \\n(1975). The availability of sulfur to rumen microbes \\nfrom different sources, organic and inorganic, has \\nbeen ranked from most to least available by Kahlon \\net al. (1975) as L-methionine, calcium sulfate, ammo\\xad\\nnium sulfate, DL-methionine, sodium sulfate, sodium \\nsulfide, elemental sulfur, and hydroxy analog of \\nmethionine. \\nMost diets that are fed to cattle contain adequate \\namounts of sulfur to meet the animal's needs, but in cer\\xad\\ntain feeding regimes, supplementation with sulfur has \\nproven beneficial. Cattle fed high-grain rations that \\nwere supplemented with nonprotein nitrogen re\\xad\\nsponded to the addition of elemental sulfur (Meiske \\net al., 1966). Rees et al. (1974) fed cattle pangola grass \\nand increased dry matter intakes and digestibilities \\nwhen either the grass was fertilized or supplemented \\nwith sulfur. \\nRequirements of beef cattle for sulfur are not well de\\xad\\nfined. Most research to determine sulfur requirements \\nof ruminants has been conducted using sheep and lactat\\xad\\ning dairy cows, both of which produce products with \\nhigher sulfur contents than do beef cattle. A diet that \\ncontained 0.106 percent sulfur met requirements of 5-to \\n11-week-old calves (Leibholz, 1972). The beef cow, \\nwhether in gestation or lactation, is thought to have sul\\xad\\nfur requirements that are similar to those of finishing \\ncattle. \\nThe interrelationship between copper, molybdenum, \\nand sulfur has received wide attention. Copper require\\xad\\nments are increased by both sulfur and molybdenum. Copper forms cupric sulfide, which is insoluble in all \\nparts of the digestive tract. Cupric molybdate may also \\nbe formed. Cupric molybdate can be absorbed but is \\nmetabolically inactive (Dowdy and Matrone, 1968a,b). \\nA third compound that reduces the availability of cop\\xad\\nper is unabsorbable copper thiomolydate (Huisingh \\net al., 1973; Dick et al., 1974). \\nThe interrelationship between selenium and sulfur is \\ndue in part to their similar structures. Selenium can re\\xad\\nplace sulfur in some organic compounds, but the met\\xad\\nabolic activity of the seleno-compound is less than that \\nof the normal sulfur-containing compound (Diplock, \\n1976). Selenium toxicity can be counteracted by the \\nfeeding of sulfur, but the form of the sulfur is a major \\nfactor. Whanger (1970) showed that selenium absorp\\xad\\ntion was decreased by sulfur compounds with the most \\ninfluence being exhibited on seleno-compounds by its \\nsulfur analog. \\nSigns of sulfur deficiency include reduced appetite, \\nweight loss, weakness, excessive salivation, watery eyes, \\ndullness, emaciation, and death (Thomas et al., 1951; \\nStarks et al., 1953; Whanger, 1968). In a sulfur defi\\xad\\nciency, microbial protein synthesis is reduced, and the \\nanimal shows signs of protein malnutrition. A lack of \\nsulfur also results in a microbial population that does \\nnot utilize lactate; therefore, lactate accumulates in the \\nrumen, blood, and urine (Whanger and Matrone, 1966, \\n1967). Serum sulfate levels have been suggested as an \\nindicator of sulfur deficiency (Weir and Rendig, 1952), \\nbut blood lactate and dietary sulfur levels may be the \\nmost reliable indicators of sulfur status (Goodrich et al., \\n1978). \\nSulfur toxicity is characterized by restlessness, diar\\xad\\nrhea, muscular twitching, dyspnea, and in prolonged \\ncases by inactivity followed by death (Coghlin, 1944). \\nThe cause of these signs of toxicosis is thought to be sul\\xad\\nfide, which is produced in large quantities when high\\xad\\nsulfur rations are fed (Bray, 1969). Since sulfate may be \\nabsorbed readily throughout the digestive tract, excesses \\nmay lead to metabolic acidosis. The suggested maxi\\xad\\nmum level for sulfur in the diet is 0.4 percent (NRC, \\n1980), but Bouchard and Conrad (1976) suggested a \\nlower level (0.26 percent) for lactating dairy cows. \\nAll feeds contain some sulfur, but the amount usually \\ndepends on the protein content of the feed. Feeds higher \\nin protein will usually have more sulfur. Availability of \\nthe sulfur in the feed to microbial reduction in the ru\\xad\\nmen may be of as much concern as the actual amount \\nthat is present. \\nZinc \\nZinc (Zn) has been recognized as an essential element \\nfor animals since 1935 (Bertrand and Bhattacherjee, \", metadata={'source': '/content/19398.pdf', 'page': 30}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle\\nCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.\\n1935). Requirements for zinc are based on its biochem\\xad\\nical function as both an activator and constituent of sev\\xad\\neral dehydrogenases, peptidases, and phosphatases that \\nare involved in nucleic acid metabolism, protein synthe\\xad\\nsis, and carbohydrate metabolism (Vallee, 1959; Under\\xad\\nwood, 1956; HsuandAnilare, 1966; Millsetal., 1969). \\nZinc concentration in the body of cattle is approxi\\xad\\nmately 30 ppm. Zinc is found in high concentrations in \\nsoft tissues such as the pancreas, liver, pituitary gland, \\nkidney, and adrenal gland. Bone, teeth, hair, and the \\nchoroid and iris of the eye are also high in zinc content. \\nIn males, testicles and accessory sex glands have high \\nzinc concentrations . Normal plasma zinc levels range \\nfrom 80 to 120 JJ.g per 100 ml, with one-third of the zinc \\nfirmly bound to globulin and the remainder loosely \\nbound to albumin (Vallee, 1962). \\nAbsorption of zinc occurs primarily from the aboma\\xad\\nsum and lower small intestine, with little zinc absorbed \\nbelow the cecum (Miller and Cragle, 1965). Feces is the \\nprimary route of zinc excretion . Little zinc is excreted in \\nurine (Feaster et al., 1954). Fecal zinc includes unab\\xad\\nsorbed zinc, zinc secreted into the gut, zinc from bile \\nand pancreatic secretions, and zinc from desquamated \\nepithelial cells. \\nZinc requirements of cattle are not precisely defined. \\nResults of several trials suggest requirements to be be\\xad\\ntween 20 and 40 mg/kg diet dry matter (Miller et al., \\n1962, 1963; Mills et al., 1967). In other trials, feeding \\nhigher levels improved performance (Perry et al., 1968). \\nRequirements may be altered by dietary levels of cad\\xad\\nmium, calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, molyb\\xad\\ndenum, and selenium since these minerals affect zinc \\nabsorption and/or utilization (Van Campen and Mitch\\xad\\nell, 1965; Holod et al., 1969; Van Campen, 1969; Suttle \\nand Field, 1970; Ivan and Grieve, 1975). Requirements \\nvary according to age and growth rate, since zinc ab\\xad\\nsorption decreases with age and as growth rate de\\xad\\ncreases (Stake et al., 1973). Beef cows with high levels of \\nmilk production have higher requirements, since milk \\ncontains 300 to 500 mg of zinc per liter. \\nZinc deficiencies have been reported in ruminants \\ngrazing forages low in zinc or high in compounds inter\\xad\\nfering with zinc utilization (Pierson, 1966; Mayland, \\n1975). Deficiencies are characterized by decreased per\\xad\\nformance and listlessness, followed by development of \\nswollen feet and a dermititis that is most severe on the \\nneck, head, and legs. Deficiencies may also result in vi\\xad\\nsion impairment , excessive salivation, decreased rumen, \\nvolatile fatty acid production, and a failure of wounds \\nto heal normally (Miller et al., 1965; Ott et al., 1965; \\nPierson, 1966; Mills et al., 1967). Impaired reproduc\\xad\\ntive performance may occur in zinc-deficient bulls and \\ncows (Pitts et al., 1966). \\nReadily available stores of zinc are small, and deple-Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 25 \\ntion is reflected by a rapid drop in liver and plasma zinc. \\nDeficiencies are difficult to detect in early stages or in \\nmilder forms. Biochemical changes with promising di\\xad\\nagnostic value are declines in zinc concentration in \\nplasma, hair, and tissue. However, perhaps the best in\\xad\\ndicator is increased feed intake and growth after feeding \\nsupplemental zinc, since deficient cattle respond rap\\xad\\nidly to supplemental zinc (Miller and Miller, 1962; Mills \\net al., 1967). \\nThe extent of zinc tolerance is dependent on the diet, \\nparticularly concentrations of minerals that affect zinc \\nabsorption and utilization. Therefore, the threshold for \\nzinc toxicity cannot be adequately defined. Steers have \\nbeen fed diets containing 1000 ppm zinc for 13 to 18 \\nmonths without marked reduction of performance \\n(Feaster et al., 1954). \\nPlant species vary widely in zinc concentration, with \\nlegumes usually having higher concentrations than \\ngrasses. In general, most hays and silages contain less \\nthan 60 ppm zinc. Cereal grains normally contain be\\xad\\ntween 10 and 30 ppm zinc. Protein supplements of plant \\norigin contain 50 to 70 ppm zinc, and those of animal \\norigin contain 90 to 100 ppm zinc. Sources of inorganic \\nzinc that may be used to supplement cattle include ace\\xad\\ntate, carbonate, chloride, and sulfate and metallic zinc \\n(NRC, 1980). \\nVITAMINS \\nCattle have physiological requirements for most vita\\xad\\nmins required by other mammals. Furthermore, calves \\nfrom adequately fed mothers have minimal stores of vi\\xad\\ntamins at birth. Synthesis by microorganisms in the ru\\xad\\nmen, supplies in natural feedstuffs, and synthesis in tis\\xad\\nsues meet most of the usual requirements. Colostrum is \\nrich in vitamins, providing immediate protection to the \\nnewborn calf. The ability to synthesize B vitamins and \\nvitamin Kin the rumen develops rapidly when solid feed \\nis introduced into the diet. Vitamin Dis synthesized by \\nanimals exposed to direct sunlight and is found in large \\namounts in sun-cured forages. High-quality forages \\ncontain large amounts of vitamin A precursors and vita\\xad\\nminE. \\nVitamin A \\nThe vitamin A requirements for beef cattle are 2200 \\nIU per kilogram of dry feed for feedlot cattle; 2800 IU \\nper kilogram for pregnant heifers and cows, and 3900 \\nIU per kilogram for lactating cows and breeding bulls \\nGones et al., 1938; Guilbert and Hart, 1935; Guilbert \\net al., 1940; Madsen et al., 1948; Church et al., 1956; \\nChapman et al., 1964; Cullison and Ward, 1965; Perry ', metadata={'source': '/content/19398.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n",

These requirements are the \\nsame as those given in the fifth edition of this report \\n(NRC, 1976). An IU is defined as 0.300 J.Lg of vitamin A \\nalcohol (retinol) or 0.550 J.Lg of vitamin A palmitate. Ef\\xad\\nficiency of conversion of carotenoids to retinol is vari\\xad\\nable in beef cattle and generally lower than that for \\nnonruminant animals (Ullrey, 1972). One milligram of \\n13-carotene is assigned a value of 400 IU (2.5 J.Lg 13-caro\\xad\\ntene per IU). While it is common for commercial formu\\xad\\nlators to add a safety factor to these values, general \\npractical experience with them has been satisfactory, al\\xad\\nthough systematic experimental reevaluations have not \\nbeen attempted. \\nVitamin A is the vitamin most likely to be of practical \\nimportance in feeding cattle. Although the only well\\xad\\nestablished biochemical function of vitamin A i~ its role \\nas a component of the visual purple required for dim\\xad\\nlight vision, it is essential for normal growth, reproduc\\xad\\ntion, and maintenance of healthy epithelial tissue. Vita\\xad\\nmin A activity is supplied in natural feeds mainly by \\ncarotenoid precursors. High-quality forages provide ca\\xad\\nrotenoids in large amounts but tend to be quite seasonal \\nin availability. Few grains, except for yellow corn, con\\xad\\ntain appreciable amounts of carotenoids. Carotene is \\nrapidly destroyed by exposure to sunlight and air, espe\\xad\\ncially at high temperatures. Ensiling effectively pre\\xad\\nserves carotene, but the availability of carotene from \\ncom silage may be low Gordan et al., 1963; Smith et al., \\n1964; Miller et al., 1967). \\nThe liver can store large amounts of vitamin A. These \\nstores serve to prevent vitamin A deficiency during pe\\xad\\nriods of suboptimal intake. Unfortunately, liver stores \\nare highly variable and cannot be assessed accurately \\nwithout taking samples by biopsy. The duration of pro\\xad\\ntection afforded by liver stores can vary from none to \\nperhaps a year or longer. Intakes necessary to establish \\nand maintain these stores are considerably greater than \\nthe listed requirements. The stores are in a dynamic \\nstate (Frey and Jensen, 1947; Hayes et al., 1967), but \\nfactors influencing deposition and removal are not well \\nunderstood. On a practical basis it is seldom safe to ex\\xad\\npect more than 2 to 4 months of protection from stored \\nvitamin A, and cattle should be observed carefully for \\nsigns of deficiency whenever the diet is deficient. \\nDietary vitamin A deficiency is most likely to occur \\nwhen cattle are fed (1) high-concentrate diets; (2) \\nbleached pasture or hay grown under drought condi\\xad\\ntions; (3) feeds that have had excess exposure to sunlight, \\nair, and high temperature; (4) feeds that have been \\nheavily processed or mixed with oxidizing materials \\nsuch as minerals; and (5) feeds that have been stored for long periods of time. Newborn calves deprived of colos\\xad\\ntrum and cattle that have been prevented from estab\\xad\\nlishing or maintaining good liver stores through expo\\xad\\nsure to drought, winter feeding without high-quality \\nforage, or exposure to stresses such as high temperature \\nor elevated nitrate intake are particularly susceptible. \\nDeficiencies can be corrected by increasing carotene in\\xad\\ntake through the introduction of high-quality forage or \\nby supplying vitamin A in the feed or by injection. Since \\ninefficient conversion of carotene to vitamin A is often a \\npart of the problem, administering preformed vitamin \\nA is preferred when deficiency signs are present. In\\xad\\njected vitamin A is used more efficiently than oral vita\\xad\\nmin A (Perry et al., 1967; Schelling et al., 1975), possi\\xad\\nbly because of extensive destruction of dietary vitamin A \\nin the rumen and abomasum (Keating et al., 1964; \\nKlatte et al., 1964; Mitchell et al., 1967). \\nSigns of vitamin A deficiency include reduced feed \\nintake, rough hair coat, edema of the joints and brisket, \\nlacrimation, xerophthalmia, night blindness, slow \\ngrowth, diarrhea, convulsive seizures, improper bone \\ngrowth, blindness, low conception rates, abortion, still\\xad\\nbirths, blind calves, abnormal semen, reduced libido, \\nand susceptibility to respiratory and other infections \\n(Guilbert and Hart, 1935; Jones et al., 1938; Guilbert \\net al., 1940; Guilbert and Rochford, 1940; Hart, 1940; \\nMadsen and Earle, 1947; Madsen et al., 1948; Moore, \\n1957; Mitchell, 1967). Only nyctalopia has proven \\nuniquetovitaminAdeficiency(Moore, 1939, 1941). Vi\\xad\\ntamin A deficiency should be suspected when several of \\nthese symptoms are present. Clinical verification may \\ninclude ophthalmoscopic examination, liver biopsy and \\nassay, blood assay, testing spinal fluid pressure, con\\xad\\njunctival smears, and response to vitamin A therapy. \\nThe possibility that 13-carotene may have a role in \\nreproduction independent of its role as a vitamin A \\nprecursor has received considerable recent attention \\n(Hemken and Bremel, 1982). Evaluation of these re\\xad\\nports and their potential practical significance will re\\xad\\nmain difficult until a biochemical function is proposed \\nfor carotene and either verified or rejected. \\nVitamin D \\nThe vitamin D requirement of beef cattle is 275 IU \\nper kilogram of dry diet. The IU is defined as 0.025 J.Lg of \\ncholecalciferol (D3) or its equivalent. Ergocalciferol \\n(D2) also is active in cattle. Beef cattle exposed to sun\\xad\\nlight or fed sun-cured forages rarely require vitamin D \\nsupplementation. \\nVitamin D is required for calcium and phosphorus \\nabsorption, normal mineralization of bone, and mobili\\xad\\nzation of calcium from bone.

One \\nmetabolite (25-hydroxy-vitamin-D 3) is formed in the \\nliver and is about four times as active as vitamin D. An\\xad\\nother metabolite (1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin-D 3) formed \\nin the kidney is about five times as active as 25-hydroxy\\xad\\nvitamin-D3. Extension of observations on these metabo\\xad\\nlites to cattle and study of other metabolites unique to \\nruminants are being actively pursued (Horst and Rein\\xad\\nhardt, 1983) and can be expected to add much to \\nour understanding of vitamin D nutrition. Degradation \\nof vitamin D in the rumen (Parakkasi et al., 1970; Som\\xad\\nmerfeldt et al., 1979) may be of practical significance \\nwhen considering methods of vitamin D administra\\xad\\ntion. \\nThe best defined sign of vitamin D deficiency in \\ncalves is rickets, which involves failure of bone to miner\\xad\\nalize adequately. Accompanying signs frequently in\\xad\\nclude decreases in calcium and inorganic phosphorus in \\nblood, swollen and stiff joints, anorexia, fast breathing, \\nirritability, tetany, weakness, convulsions, and re\\xad\\ntarded growth. In older animals with a vitamin D defi\\xad\\nciency, bones become weak and easily fractured, and \\nposterior paralysis may accompany vertebral fractures. \\nCalves may be born dead, weak, or deformed (Rupel \\net al., 1933; Wallis, 1944; Warner and Sutton, 1948; \\nStallings et al., 1964). \\nVitamin E \\nThe vitamin E requirement has not been clearly es\\xad\\ntablished but is estimated to be between 15 and 60 IU \\nper kilogram of dry diet for young calves. The IU is de\\xad\\nfined as 1 mg of dl-a-tocopherol acetate. Normal diets \\napparently supply adequate amounts for adult cattle. \\nEven diets very low in vitamin E did not affect growth, \\nreproduction, or lactation when fed for four generations \\n(Gullickson and Calverley, 1946). \\nVitamin E is an antioxidant and has been widely used \\nto protect and to facilitate the uptake and storage of vi\\xad\\ntamin A (Perry et al., 1968). Its action in metabolism is \\nnot clearly defined but is linked closely with selenium \\n(Muth et al., 1958; Hoekstra, 1975). Some deficiency \\nsigns, particularly white muscle disease, may respond to \\neither selenium or vitamin E or may require both. Vi\\xad\\ntamin E and selenium interactions are discussed in the \\nSelenium section. Deficiencies may be precipitated or \\naccentuated by feeding unsaturated fats. Signs of defi\\xad\\nciency in young calves are characteristic of white muscle \\ndisease. They include general muscular dystrophy, \\nweak leg muscles, crossover walking, impaired suckling \\nability due to dystrophy of tongue muscles, heart failure, \\nand paralysis (Stafford et al., 1954; Muth et al., 1958).

Most of \\nthe established metabolic functions of B vitamins are \\nimportant to cattle as well as to other animals. Conse\\xad\\nquently, a physiological need for most B vitamins can be \\nassumed for cattle of all ages. However, B vitamins are \\nabundant in milk and many other feeds, and synthesis of \\nB vitamins by rumina! microorganisms is extensive \\n(McElroy and Goss, 1940a,b, 1941a,b; Wegner et al., \\n1940, 1941; Huntet al., 1943) and begins very soon after \\nthe introduction of dry feed into the diet (Conrad and \\nHibbs, 1954). As a result, practical B-vitamin deficiency \\nis limited to situations where an antagonist is present or \\nrumina} synthesis is limited by lack of precursors or \\nother problems. \\nVitamin B12 is of special interest because of its role in \\npropionate metabolism (Marston et al., 1961) and the \\npractical incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency as a sec\\xad\\nondary result of cobalt deficiency .

The water requirement is influ\\xad\\nenced by several factors, including rate and composition \\nof gain, pregnancy, lactation, activity, type of diet, feed \\nintake, and environmental temperature. \\nRestriction of water intake reduces feed intake (Utley \\net al., 1970), which results in lower production. How\\xad\\never, water restriction tends to increase apparent digest\\xad\\nibility and nitrogen retention. \\nThe minimum requirement of cattle for water is a re\\xad\\nflection of that needed for body growth; for fetal growth \\nor lactation; and of that lost by excretion in the urine, \\nfeces, or sweat or by evaporation from the lungs or skin. \\nAnything influencing these needs or losses will influence \\nthe minimum requirement. \\nThe amount of urine produced daily varies with the \\nactivity of the animal, air temperature, and water con\\xad\\nsumption as well as with certain other factors. The anti\\xad\\ndiuretic hormone, vasopressin, controls reabsorption of \\nwater from the kidney tubules and ducts; thus, it affects \\nexcretion of urine. Under conditions of restricted water \\nintake, an animal may concentrate its urine to some ex\\xad\\ntent by resorbing a greater amount of water than usual. \\nWhile this capacity for concentration of the urine sol\\xad\\nutes is limited, it can reduce water requirements by a \\nsmall amount. When an animal consumes a diet high in \\nprotein or salt or one that contains substances having a \\ndiuretic effect, the excretion of urine is increased and so \\nis the water requirement. \\nThe water lost in the feces depends largely on the diet. \\nSucculent diets and diets with high mineral content con\\xad\\ntribute to more water in the feces. \\nThe amount of water lost through evaporation from \\n29 Water \\nthe skin or lungs is important and may even exceed that \\nlost in the urine. If temperature and/or physical activity \\nincrease, water loss through evaporation and sweating \\nincreases. \\nSince feeds themselves contain some water and the \\noxidation of certain nutrients in feeds produces water, \\nnot all must be provided by drinking. Feeds such as si\\xad\\nlages, green chop, or growing pasture forage are usually \\nvery high in moisture content, while grains, hays, and \\ndormant pasture forage are low. High-energy feeds pro\\xad\\nduce much metabolic water, while low-energy feeds \\nproduce little. These are obvious complications in the \\nmatter of assessing water requirements. Fasting animals \\nor those on a low-protein diet may form water from the \\ndestruction of body protein or fat, but this is of minor \\nsignificance. \\nThe results of water requirement studies conducted \\nunder varied conditions imply that thirst is a result of \\nneed and that animals drink to fill this need. The need \\nresults from an increase in the electrolyte concentration \\nin the body fluids, which activates the thirst mecha\\xad\\nnism. \\nAs this discussion suggests, water requirements are af\\xad\\nfected by many factors, and it is impossible to list spe\\xad\\ncific requirements with accuracy. However, the major \\ninfluences on water intake in beef cattle on typical ra\\xad\\ntions are dry matter intake, environmental tempera\\xad\\nture, and stage and type of production.

From this \\nequation, 2.15 Meal extra NEm, for example, would be \\nrequired for a pregnant cow bearing a 36-kg calf during \\nthe last 94 days of pregnancy. \\nSince determined values for NE requirements of lac\\xad\\ntating beef female are not available, they were assumed \\nto be similar to those determined for dairy cattle. The \\nrequirements listed in the tables for lactating cows were \\nbased on the metabolizable energy requirements for 5 \\nand 10 kg of milk given in Nutrient Requirements of \\nDairy Cattle (NRC, 1978) and were adjusted to a com\\xad\\nparable NEm value assuming that the milk contains 4 \\npercent fat.

Fifty-five grams per day of protein \\nhave been used as a mean rate of protein deposition in \\nthe products of conception during the last third of preg\\xad\\nnancy, assuming a 36-kg birth weight. \\nNUTRIENT RELATIONSHIPS \\nBeef cows are managed under a variety of conditions \\nto best utilize the feed resources available under existing \\nenvironmental conditions. This variation presents a \\nchallenge in applying nutrient requirements. Since the \\nbeef cow can utilize a wide array of feed sources, pro\\xad\\nduction levels to optimize economic return vary depend\\xad\\ning on the feed resources. Hence, it may not be economi\\xad\\ncal to feed cows to meet their nutrient requirements \\nwith all production systems. \\nThe source of energy is generally the first consider\\xad\\nation in determining a balanced ration for beef cows. \\nUntil the energy requirement is satisfied, protein, min\\xad\\nerals, and vitamins may not be well utilized. The \\namount of energy required for different production lev\\xad\\nels will vary. Because the beef cow uses fiber as a major \\n30 Breeding Fe01ales \\nsource of energy, the quantity of forage or feed and the \\nquality are important . \\nWhen energy is limited, supplemental protein will be \\nused for energy until the energy needs are met; then the \\nremaining protein will be used to meet the protein needs \\n(Clanton and Zimmerman, 1970). These researchers \\nhave shown, for example, that feeding high levels of \\nlow-protein (6.7 and 7.9 percent) supplements (7.2 and \\n8.0 Meal DE/day) to growing replacement heifers win\\xad\\ntered on native grass range threatened the nutritional \\nstatus of the heifers. Protein was the limiting nutrient; \\nthus, the extra supplemental energy provided no in\\xad\\ncrease in weight gain; in fact, there was a decrease. \\nWhen the added energy contained 13 or 16 percent pro\\xad\\ntein, heifers gained weight. This demonstrated that pro\\xad\\ntein, not energy, limited performance.

Visual body condition score com\\xad\\nbined with weight predicted the relative total digestible \\nnutrient (TON) requirements of pregnant cows during \\nlate gestation more accurately than do weight and milk \\nproduction alone. Maintenance energy requirements of \\ncows may be influenced by milk production potential as \\nwell as body size. \\nWEIGHT CHANGES AND BODY \\nCONDITION \\nAside from weight loss at parturition, weight change \\nin a mature cow reflects body condition change (loss or \\ngain of body fat). Weight change can be measured accu\\xad\\nrately, whereas the number scoring system (1 = thin\\xad\\nnest and 9 = fattest) for condition change is empirical \\nand subject to judgment. More accurate procedures are \\navailable for measuring body composition, but their use \\nis generally limited to experimentation. \\nIn the bred heifer, weight change is a combination of \\ngrowth and condition change. This makes nutrient re\\xad\\nquirements more difficult to assess. A thin heifer needs \\nto gain more weight during gestation than one that has a \\nmoderate or fat condition. This gain is necessary for \\ncontinued growth and rebreeding in the minimum time. \\nCondition cannot be determined by weight alone be\\xad\\ncause heifers of different frame sizes differ in weight at \\nthe same condition. Condition must be considered in \\nnutrient requirements for bred heifers. \\nWhen mature cows lose condition from inadequate \\nenergy intake prior to calving, the interval from calving \\nto first estrus will be lengthened, resulting in calving in\\xad\\ntervals exceeding 1 year (Wiltbank et al., 1962). Inade\\xad\\nquate energy intake after calving will lower conception \\nrates (Wiltbank et al., 1962, 1964). The same effect has \\nbeen demonstrated with bred yearling heifers (Clanton \\nand Zimmerman, 1970; Bellows and Short, 1978). It ap\\xad\\npears desirable to have cows gain an amount of weight \\nthe last trimester equal to the weight lost at calving. This \\nis even more important with the replacement heifer. \\nWeight gain will not necessarily reflect increased condi\\xad\\ntion. Condition is often lost prior to calving. Weight \\ngain between calving and breeding is desirable and will \\nimprove conception rates, resulting in a shorter calving \\ninterval. Phillips and Vavra (1981) showed that cows \\nlosing weight ( 18 kg) the last trimester of pregnancy had \\nas short an interval from calving to first estrus as those \\nthat gained weight (48 kg) during that period (58 versus \\n56 days). Both groups lost weight from calving until \\nbreeding, but there was no difference in conception \\nrates (86 versus 84 percent, respectively) in a 60-day \\nbreeding season. Those that gained weight prior to calv\\xad\\ning lost the most weight after calving. One might have Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 31 \\nexpected a higher conception rate had they gained \\nweight following calving. Many cows do not gain \\nweight between calving and breeding yet maintain ac\\xad\\nceptable conception rates. Cows need to be in good con\\xad\\ndition prior to calving to do this. It is costly to have cows \\ngain weight following calving because it generally re\\xad\\nquires feeding of supplemental energy and protein. The \\nsmall increase in production may not offset the increase \\nin cost. If cows can be placed on new growth pasture \\nforage 3 to 4 weeks prior to the breeding season, they \\nwill start gaining weight and show improved reproduc\\xad\\ntive performance (Clanton et al., 1971). \\nCows in good condition are more tolerant to the \\nstresses of winter and require less maintenance energy \\nper unit of weight than do cows in poor condition \\n(Thompson et al., 1983). Klosterman et al. (1968) estab\\xad\\nlished a relationship between the height at the hooks and \\nthe weight of a cow that can be used to adjust energy \\nrequirements for cows in different conditions. The aver\\xad\\nage weight (kg) to height (em) ratio for a cow in good \\ncondition is 4.0: 1. The adjustment in digestible energy \\n(DE) required by mature cows in different condition \\ncan be determined using the following formula: (4.0 -\\nweight/height) X 1.716 = Meal/day adjustment. Clan\\xad\\nton and Zimmerman ( 1970) have shown that changes in \\nwither height and heart girth circumference along with \\nweight change can be used to separate growth from \\nchange in condition of bred heifers. \\nIn many range areas or during periods of feed scar\\xad\\ncity, lactating and breeding females frequently lose \\nweight during part of the year. Weight may be regained \\nduring periods of more abundant feed. Cyclic loss and \\ngain of weight may not be detrimental to overall calf \\nproduction, depending on the length and severity of the \\npoor feed conditions and the physiological status of the \\nanimals. Calf production should be greater if condition \\ndid not cycle, but preventing condition changes may not \\nbe economically feasible. The requirements listed in the \\ntables for lactating and breeding females need to be ad\\xad\\njusted according to previous or anticipated feed avail\\xad\\nability and the economics associated with management \\nof a particular enterprise. \\nWeight loss at parturition should be considered when \\nusing the requirement tables.

Forage availability, use of supplements, and cli\\xad\\nmatic conditions also affect intake. Other influencing \\nfactors include animal size, milk production, and repro\\xad\\nductive status. \\nThe range in voluntary intake of organic matter by \\ncattle grazing native winter range forage in the Central \\nGreat Plains is 45 to 60 g/kg W0·75 (Rittenhouse et al., \\n1970; Scaleset al., 1974; Yates et al., 1982). In contrast, \\norganic matter intake of native summer range forage in \\nthe same region varies from 70 to 85 g/kg W0·75 daily \\n(Streeter et al., 1968; Powell et al., 1982; Yates et al., \\n1982). Forage intake of grazing cattle is reduced if quan\\xad\\ntity or quality of pasture is not adequate Oohnstone\\xad\\nWallace and Kennedy, 1944; Hennessy and Robinson, \\n1979; Holloway et al., 1979). In meeting nutrient re\\xad\\nquirements of grazing cattle, the condition of the range \\nor pasture and the amount of available forage present \\nmust be considered. \\nCertain supplements to low-quality forage may de\\xad\\ncrease forage intake (Forbes et al., 1967; Lusby et al., \\n1976; Rittenhouseet al., 1970; Scaleset al., 1974; Umoh \\nand Holmes, 1974). Other supplements increase forage \\nintake (Campling et al., 1962; Blaxter and Wilson, \\n1963; Clanton and Zimmerman, 1970). The primary \\ndifference in the intake response appears to be associ\\xad\\nated with the protein content of the forage and the \\namount of supplement fed. If the forage is low in pro\\xad\\ntein, forage intake will increase when a small amount of \\na high-protein supplement is fed. But when more than \\n1 kg of supplement is fed, forage intake could be reduced \\nby displacement. \\nForage intake of grazing cattle can be greatly reduced \\nby short periods of cold weather with snow cover (Rit\\xad\\ntenhouse et al., 1970); yet this is a time when more \\nenergy is needed to meet increased maintenance re\\xad\\nquirements (NRC, 1981). Supplemental forage or con\\xad\\ncentrate feeding should be given during such times to \\navoid large losses of weight. \\nPregnant cows nearing parturition consume 12 to 13 \\npercent less feed than nonpregnant cows (Campling, \\n1966; Jordan et al., 1973). Consumption increases rap\\xad\\nidly following parturition. If forage quality is low, sup\\xad\\nplementing with higher-quality forage or with concen\\xad\\ntrates prior to parturition may be necessary to compen\\xad\\nsate for reduced feed intake. \\nDry matter intake of beef cows is extremely variable. \\nDaily intakes of lactating cows have ranged from 4.5 to \\n14.5 kg Oohnstone-Wallace and Kennedy, 1944). \\nQuantity and quality were the major factors influencing \\nintake. Lactating (spring calving) or gestating (fall calv-ing) cows grazing crested wheat grass pasture during the \\nsummer in Oregon had similar intakes, 11.39 versus \\n11.37 kg daily (Kartchner et al., 1979). This was 3.0 and \\n2.8 percent of their spring body weight, respectively. \\nLactating cows were 34 kg lighter at the start of the \\ngrazing season. Holloway et al. (1979) observed that \\nAngus cows that were nursing calves and grazing Ken\\xad\\ntucky-31 tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb) in the \\nsummer consumed 10.5 kg of dry matter per day when it \\nhad a high quality (70 percent digestible) and 8.8 kg \\nwhen it was of poor quality (58 percent digestible). \\nStreeter et al.

Milk production in a 14-\\nhourperiod was6.0, 4.4, and3.5 kg, respectively. Like\\xad\\nwise, Lusby et al.

The purpose of this \\nsection is to define major effects of processing on their \\nnutritive value for beef cattle rather than on the meth\\xad\\nods per se. Reviews of the methods are provided in the \\nreferences. \\nRoughages \\nCoarse chopping of long roughages, with or without \\nwafering, does not affect nutritive value substantially \\nand is recommended primarily to improve handling \\n(Minson, 1963). In contrast, fine grinding oflong rough\\xad\\nages, which is usually followed by pelleting, increases \\nfeed intake by 50 percent or more (Greenhalgh and \\nWainman, 1972). Larger responses in intake through \\ngrinding and pelleting are associated with poorer-qual\\xad\\nity roughages and with diets where roughage is the ma\\xad\\njor constituent. Furthermore, grinding and pelleting of \\nroughage increase its intake more in young cattle than \\nin older cattle. Grinding and pelleting of roughages de\\xad\\npress their digestibility, by up to 5 percentage units. Di\\xad\\ngestibility is depressed most when intake of the pro\\xad\\ncessed material is high and when the roughage processed \\nis grass (Campling and Milne, 1972). In contrast to de\\xad\\npressing digestibility, grinding and pelleting improve \\nutilization of the digestible energy, so that net energy \\nper unit weight of the processed material exceeds the \\ncorresponding unprocessed roughage (Greenhalgh and \\nWainman, 1972). This effect is partly due to processing \\ncausing a higher percentage of the roughage to be di\\xad\\ngested postruminally. When artificially drying rough\\xad\\nages, care should be exercised to avoid the browning re\\xad\\naction, which renders some of the protein indigestible \\n(Goering, 1976). \\n33 Special \\nConsiderations \\nIn North America, many crops are preserved by ensil\\xad\\ning. This practice may depress voluntary intake relative \\nto other methods of preservation, such as drying, but it \\nhas a small effect on digestibility and utilization of di\\xad\\ngested energy (McDonald and Edwards, 1976). In dry \\nand poorly packed silage, heating may depress protein \\ndigestibility (Thomas et al., 1972). Processing of forages \\nprior to ensiling can influence nutritional value. Intake \\nof grass silage chopped to 20 mm may be greater than \\nthe intake of unchopped material (Murdoch, 1965), and \\ncorn silage harvested at a theoretical cut of 12.7 mm or \\nless was more digestible than com silage chopped at a \\nlonger length (Sudweeks et al., 1979). \\nAlkali treatments of crop residues and wastes have \\nbeen researched and reviewed (Homb et al., 1977; \\nKernan et al., 1977; Jackson, 1978; Sundstel et al., \\n1978; Klopfenstein et al., 1979). The effectiveness of al\\xad\\nkali treatment depends on the residue or waste being \\ntreated and the technique. Results vary substantially. \\nTreatment with alkali increases potential digestion of \\ncell walls. Although rates of digestion in the rumen are \\nnot altered substantially, rates of passage of indigestible \\nmaterial are improved (Berger et al., 1979; Coombe \\net al., 1979; Oji et al., 1980). Hence, voluntary intake of \\nlow-quality roughages can be improved by up to 50 per\\xad\\ncent through alkali treatment (Horton, 1978; Coombe \\net al., 1979; Garrett et al., 1979; Horton and Steacy, \\n1979; Morris and Mowat, 1980; Saenger et al., 1982). \\nThese studies have also demonstrated that digestibility \\nof dry matter or energy may be increased by up to 10 \\npercentage units.

The improvement in intake through \\nchemical treatment may be small when treated rough\\xad\\nage is compared with untreated roughage in the ground \\nand pelleted form (Coombe et al., 1979; Horrisberger \\net al., 1979). Alkali treatment, through its heating ef\\xad\\nfect, depresses the nitrogen digestibility by ruminants, \\neven when ammonia is used (Garrett et al., 1979; Hor\\xad\\nton and Steacy, 1979; Morris and Mowat, 1980; Oji et \\nal., 1980). Since energy availability in the rumen is en\\xad\\nhanced by alkali treatment, supplementation of treated \\nroughages with more extensively degraded protein \\nsources is usually beneficial. \\nGrains \\nINTRODUCTION \\nMany factors other than processing have a bearing on \\nthe nutritive value of grains and may modify the effects \\nof processing. High intakes reduce digestibility. For ex\\xad\\nample, the metabolizable energy of corn grain for dairy \\ncows was reduced from 3.58 Meal/kg at a maintenance \\nlevel of feeding to 2.92 Meal/kg at 2.5 times mainte\\xad\\nnance (Moe and Tyrrell, 1979). Source of grain also may \\nhave a major impact on digestibility. For example, the \\nnet energy of bird-resistant sorghum has been found to \\nbe considerably less than regular sorghum grain (Max\\xad\\nson et al., 1973), whereas waxy sorghum has a higher \\nnet energy (Sherrod et al., 1969). Within varieties of the \\nsame grain, total digestible nutrients (TDN) were found \\nto vary by 7 percentage units (Parrot et al., 1969). Effect \\nof processing may be less pronounced when available \\nenergy in the unprocessed grain is relatively high or \\nwhen feed intake is relatively low. Since younger cattle \\ncan digest unprocessed grain better than older animals \\n(Morgan and Campling, 1978), processing of grain \\nshould benefit the nutritive value of rations for yearling \\nsteers more than for calves less than a year old. Finally, \\nresponse to processing grain depends on the level of \\nroughage in the diet, and relevant details are presented \\nfor individual grains. \\nCORN \\nIn rations containing at least 80 percent dry corn \\ngrain, equivalent DE and NE values have been reported \\nwhether the corn has been cracked, ground, or fed \\nwhole (Goodrich and Meiske, 1966; Vance et al., 1970, \\n1972; Preston, 1975). Steam processing and flaking in\\xad\\ncreased net energy by at least 10 percent, in comparison \\nto whole corn, when the diets incorporated inert rough-ages, but was without effect in an all-com diet (Vance \\net al., 1970). With corn diets containing intermediate \\nlevels of roughage (20 to 35 percent), digestibility of \\nstarch in the diet was increased approximately 5 percent\\xad\\nage units when the grain was ground or crimped as op\\xad\\nposed to being unprocessed (Vanceet al., 1972; Galyean \\net al., 1979). Steam processing and flaking improved en\\xad\\nergy retention in cattle from 6 to 10 percent, relative to \\ncracked corn, when the grain was incorporated into fat\\xad\\ntening rations composed of 70 to 80 percent corn Oohn\\xad\\nson et al., 1968). In low-roughage diets, feeding corn in \\nthe unprocessed form (whole corn grain) maximizes in\\xad\\ntake and facilitates cattle management. Steam process\\xad\\ning and flaking should also maximize intake in diets con\\xad\\ntaining either low or intermediate levels of roughage. \\nGenerally, with diets containing more than 35 percent \\nroughage, digestibility of the corn is positively associ\\xad\\nated with fineness of grind, so that finely ground corn \\ncontains 10 percentage units more digestible energy \\nthan whole corn (Moe and Tyrrell, 1977, 1979). Feeding \\nof corn in a fine form in these rations, however, can be \\ndetrimental to utilization of the roughage portion of the \\ndiet (Moe et al., 1973; 0rskov, 1976, 1979) and may \\nmake these diets unpalatable. Thus, fine grinding \\nshould be restricted to maximize the nutritive value of \\nthe entire diet. Coarse grinding is most desirable to com\\xad\\nbine favorable digestion of the corn and maintain nutri\\xad\\ntive value of the roughage. \\nIn many areas of North America, corn is preserved \\nwet as high-moisture grain. Digestible dry matter and \\nenergy of rations containing high-moisture corn are at \\nleast equal and may be as much as 5 percentage units \\nhigher than the same ration containing dry ground corn \\n(McCaffree and Merrill, 1968; McKnight et al., 1973; \\nTonroy et al., 1974; Galyean et al., 1976; Macleod \\net al., 1976). These results are also evident for dry corn \\nreconstituted with moisture and stored for a short pe\\xad\\nriod of time before feeding (Tonroy et al., 1974). One \\ndetriment to the nutritive value of high-moisture corn is \\nthat reduced dry matter intakes of diets containing this \\nform of corn have been observed (Clark, 1975). This is \\nmost evident when the corn contains more than 30 per\\xad\\ncent moisture. A minor concern about high-moisture \\ncorn is that most, if not all, of its vitamin E may be lost \\nduring storage (Young et al., 1975). \\nSORGHUM \\nIn low-roughage ( < 20 percent) diets, steam process\\xad\\ning and flaking have been shown to improve DE and \\nTDN by 5 to 10 percentage units (Husted et al., 1968; \\nBuchanan-Smith et al., 1968) and starch digestibility \\nfrom 3 to 5 percentage units (McNeill et al., 1971; Hin\\xad\\nman and Johnson, 1974).

All rights reserved.\\nsuccess in steam processing and flaking is to generate a \\ndensity of 2.5 kg/hl (25 lb/bushel} or slightly less than \\none half that of the original grain. Reconstitution of the \\nwhole grain with water, followed by an incubation pe\\xad\\nriod, and grinding can improve energy and starch di\\xad\\ngestibility to the same extent as steam processing and \\nflaking (Buchanan-Smith et al., 1968; McNeill et al., \\n1971; Kieslinget al., 1973}. However, steam processing \\nand flaking may be more successful than reconstitution \\nin promoting high intake (Franks et al., 1972}. Despite \\nfavorable reports on the feeding value of steam-pro\\xad\\ncessed, flaked sorghum grain, relative to dry processing \\nmethods (Newsom et al., 1968; Franks et al., 1972}, \\nsteam processing and rolling did not improve net energy \\nof sorghum grain relative to dry grinding (Garrett, \\n1965}. It has been reported that the NEm and NEg values \\nfor sorghum were both increased by 8 percentage units \\nthrough fine grinding as opposed to coarse rolling; thus, \\nfine grinding may improve the value of sorghum to an \\nextent comparable to steam processing and flaking \\n(Brethour, 1980}. In intermediate- and high-roughage \\ndiets, dry-rolled sorghum is better utilized than in low\\xad\\nroughage diets (Keating et al., 1965}. Thus, it is unlikely \\nthat steam processing and flaking will have beneficial \\neffects in these circumstances . The nutritive value of dry \\nsorghum grain in low-roughage diets may be improved \\nby heat treatments, other than steam processing and \\nflaking, such as popping, micronizing, exploding, \\nand roasting (Hale and Theurer, 1972}. Micronizing \\nand popping of sorghum grain can improve digestibility \\nof starch to an extent similar to steam processing and \\nflaking (Riggs et al., 1970; Hinman and Johnson, 1974; \\nCrokaandWagner,1975}. Thesetreatmentsmaynotbe \\nas successful as steam processing and flaking for promo\\xad\\ntion of high intake of low-roughage diets. \\nBARLEY \\nGrinding or rolling improves the digestibility and uti\\xad\\nlization of barley. NEm values of ground barley ranging \\nfrom 1.69 to 1.89 Meal/kg and NEg values from 1.03 to \\n1.39 Meal/kg in all-concentrate and 25 percent rough\\xad\\nage diets have been reported (Suleiman and Mathison, \\n1979}. No benefit for steam processing and flaking of \\nbarley, versus dry rolling, were demonstrated in one ex\\xad\\nperiment (Parrot et al., 1969}. To maximize intake and \\nminimize digestive disturbances such as bloat, it is rec\\xad\\nommended that in high-or all-concentrate diets, barley \\nbe fed with medium grind to avoid fines (Hironaka \\net al., 1979}. High-moisture barley can have a nutritive \\nvalue for cattle comparable to the dry ground or rolled \\nform. It is also recommended that high-moisture barley \\nbe medium rather than fine grind to reduce the propor\\xad\\ntion of fines. Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 35 \\nOATS \\nAlthough whole oats may be better utilized by cattle \\nthan whole barley (Morgan and Campling, 1978}, roll\\xad\\ning or grinding improves its utilization also. \\nWHEAT \\nWhole wheat may be efficiently utilized by cattle \\n(Trowbridge and Moffett, 1933}, but its nutritive value \\nis improved by processing. Hale et al. (1970} reported \\nthat steam-processed and flaked wheat was well utilized \\nby cattle provided the flakes were not thin. Fine grind\\xad\\ning of wheat generally reduces feed intake and is ex\\xad\\ntremely liable to cause acidosis, although acidosis de\\xad\\npends on the variety of wheat fed. Garrett et al. (1966} \\nand Garrett (1968} reported that heat treatment of \\nwheat improved its digestibility but did not significantly \\nimprove its net energy. It can be concluded that the nu\\xad\\ntritive value of wheat is optimized by dry rolling, coarse \\ngrinding, or steam processing to produce a thick flake \\n(Brethour, 1970}. \\nENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON \\nNUTRIENT REQUIREMENTS OF BEEF \\nCATTLE \\nA subcommittee of the Committee of Animal Nutri\\xad\\ntion prepared a report, Effect of Environment on Nutri\\xad\\nent Requirements of Domestic Animals (NRC, 1981b }, \\nthat details how requirements for beef cattle might be \\naltered to account for environmental stresses. A sum\\xad\\nmary of the report's recommendations is presented here. \\nFirst, voluntary food intake can be significantly af\\xad\\nfected by the environment, particularly with effective \\nambient temperatures outside the thermoneutral zone \\n15° to 25°C. With high temperature and humidity, in\\xad\\ntake may be depressed by up to 30 percent. The extent of \\nthis depression is positively associated with temperature \\nand humidity. High-temperature stress will be reduced \\nif accompanied by low humidity and/or relief through \\nmore comfortable nighttime conditions . Intake depres\\xad\\nsion through elevated temperature and humidity is \\nmore severe for high-roughage as opposed to low-rough\\xad\\nage diets. With low temperatures, intake may be in\\xad\\ncreased by up to 30 percent. The extent of this increase is \\nnegatively associated with temperature. An increase in \\nintake caused by low temperatures should be observed \\nwhen cattle remain relatively dry, but extensive precipi\\xad\\ntation and muddy conditions can depress intake by up to \\n30 percent in both the thermoneutral zone and at lower \\ntemperatures . Intake can also become severely re\\xad\\nstricted for beef cows on range during winter. Forage \", metadata={'source': '/content/19398.pdf', 'page': 41}),\n",

Temperature \\nand digestibility appear to be positively related. These \\nalterations are required only for roughages because ef\\xad\\nfects of temperature on digestibility of concentrates are \\nsmall. DE, ME, and NE values of roughages may be \\nmodified by the following formula: \\nA = B + B(O.OOIO (T -20)), \\nwhere A is the value adjusted for environmental temper\\xad\\nature, B is the unadjusted value, and T is the effective \\nambient temperature (0C). \\nThird, the maintenance energy requirement of cattle \\nshould be adjusted for exposure to temperatures outside \\nthe thermoneutral zone. Adapted animals should have \\ntheir requirements adjusted to allow for changes in ba\\xad\\nsal metabolic rate and, possibly, for acute exposure to \\nhot or cold. Unadapted animals should have their re\\xad\\nquirements adjusted for acute exposure to either hot or \\ncold only. For adapted animals, maintenance energy ex\\xad\\npenditure decreases rectilinearly in association with in\\xad\\ncreasing temperature. The following equation is used to \\nexpress the maintenance energy requirement: \\nNE = a.W0·75, \\nwhere NE is the net energy required for maintenance \\n(Meal/day), and W is the body weight (kg). \\nFor animals acclimated to 20°C (thermoneutral \\nzone), the factor a is taken as 0.077. For each degree \\nCelcius prior to exposure to temperatures above or be\\xad\\nlow 20°C, 0.0007 should be subtracted or added, re\\xad\\nspectively, to a in the above equation. Thus, for cattle \\nwith prior exposure to temperatures of 30°, 20°, 10°, \\nand 0°C, the value a becomes 0.070, 0.077, 0.084, and \\n0.091, respectively. For expressing maintenance energy \\nrequirements in terms of ME or DE, tabulated values \\nshould be decreased (for heat) or increased (for cold) by \\n0.91 percent for each degree Celcius prior exposure \\nabove or below 20°C. \\nFor acute heat stress, maintenance energy require\\xad\\nments should be adjusted according to severity. Severity \\nmay be detected by the respiration of the animal. For \\nrapid shallow breathing the maintenance energy re\\xad\\nquirement should be increased by 7 percent, whereas for \\ndeep open-mouth panting the requirement should be in\\xad\\ncreased from 11 to 25 percent. \\nFor acute cold stress, maintenance energy expendi\\xad\\ntures should be increased according to exposure to tem\\xad\\nperatures below their lower critical temperature \\n(LCT). Calculation of the LCT for any given animal is complex and depends on the animal's insulation and \\nheat production . Wind speed influences insulation and \\nis an important environmental factor. LCT varies \\nwidely for different cattle and according to environ\\xad\\nment. For example, for a 1-week-old calf exposed to \\ndry, low wind, the LCT is estimated at + 7. 7°C, \\nwhereas for a yearling steer gaining 1.1 kg/day and ex\\xad\\nposed to a dry, low wind, the LCT is estimated at \\n-34.1 °C. The increase in ME required per degree Cel\\xad\\ncius below the LCT is from 1 to 3 percent. For details on \\ncalculating the increase in energy requirement due to \\nacute cold exposure, the reader is referred to the report \\nEffect of Environment on Nutrient Requirements of Do\\xad\\nmestic Animals (NRC, 1981b). \\nIMPLANTS AND NONNUTRITIVE FEED \\nADDITIVES \\nMelengesterol acetate (MCA) is a feed additive mar\\xad\\nketed for feedlot heifers. MCA is a progestin and acts to \\nsuppress estrus, increase gains, and improve feed effi\\xad\\nciency with finishing heifers. Sexually mature, non\\xad\\ngravid heifers respond to MCA, whereas it has no effect \\non the performance of steers, bulls, and spayed or preg\\xad\\nnant heifers. The approved daily feeding level is from \\n0.25 to 0.50 mg per head. Feeds containing MCA must \\nbe withdrawn at least 48 hours prior to slaughter . \\nSynovex implants are of two types. Synovex-S for \\nsteers contains 20 mg of estradiol benzoate and 200 mg \\nof progesterone . It is approved for use in steers that \\nweigh 182 (400 lb) to455 kg (1000 lb). Synovex-H for use \\nwith feedlot heifers contains 20 mg of estradiol benzoate \\nand 200 mg of testosterone. It is approved for heifers \\nweighing 182 (400 lb) to 364 kg (800 lb). Use of these \\nproducts improves rate of gain and efficiency of feed uti\\xad\\nlization. Maximum responses are obtained with a high\\xad\\nconcentrate finishing diet. In the United States and \\nCanada there is no withdrawal prior to slaughter. \\nRalgro (Zeranol) implants are available for male and \\nfemale nursing calves, grazing cattle, and cattle fed fin\\xad\\nishing diets and are not for use with breeding animals. \\nRalgro improves rate of gain and efficiency of feed utili\\xad\\nzation. The approved dose is 36 mg. Animals must not \\nbe implanted within 65 days of slaughter. \\nEstradiol is available in the United States as a timed\\xad\\nrelease implant (Compudose), active for a 200-day pe\\xad\\nriod. Use of this product improves rate of gain and effi\\xad\\nciency of feed utilization by feedlot cattle. There is no \\nwithdrawal period prior to slaughter. \\nAntibiotics are added to diets to improve rate of gain \\nand feed efficiency . Several antibiotics reduce the inci\\xad\\ndence of liver abscesses in cattle fed high-concentrate \", metadata={'source': '/content/19398.pdf', 'page': 42}),\n",

The level for continuous feeding is 70 to 80 mg per \\nhead per day. Antibiotics are also approved at higher \\nlevels for beef cattle for the first 14 to 28 days after trans\\xad\\nport to help control shipping fever. Antibiotics that are \\napproved for use and restrictions to their use are listed in \\nthe Feed Additives Compendium published annually by \\nMiller Publishing Co., Minneapolis, Minnesota, for the \\nUnited States, or the Compendium of Medicating Ingre\\xad\\ndient Brochures published by Agriculture Canada for \\nCanada. \\nMonensin sodium is approved for use in cattle feeds at \\nlevels between 5 and 30 g per ton of complete feed (90 \\npercent dry matter basis) or at daily feeding levels be\\xad\\ntween 50 and 360 mg per day. With feedlot cattle, \\nmonensin generally improves feed efficiency but de\\xad\\npresses feed intake, with no effect on rate of gain. \\nMonensin is approved for use with pasture cattle at a \\ndaily feeding level of 200 mg per day for improvement in \\nrate of gain. Monensin alters the ratio of volatile fatty \\nacids produced in the rumen by increasing the propor\\xad\\ntion of propionic acid. Monensin may reduce fasting \\nheat production and may increase dietary NEm values to \\na greater extent than it increases dietary NEg values. \\nMonensin has also been shown to increase quantities of \\ndietary protein that escape degradation in the rumen. In \\naddition, retention of some minerals has been increased \\nin monensin-fed cattle. Thus, energy, protein, and min\\xad\\neral requirements may be modified when monensin is \\nfed to cattle. The same probably applies to other \\nionophores that may be fed to cattle, but data on the Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle 37 \\nother ionophores are not available (Poos et al., 1979; \\nGarrett, 1982; Kirk et al., 1983). \\nLasalocid sodium is approved for use in cattle feeds in \\nthe United States at levels between 10 and 30 g per ton of \\ncomplete feed (90 percent dry matter basis) for improve\\xad\\nment in feed efficiency. It is approved for use at 25 to 30 g \\nper ton for increased rate of gain. \\nSeveral products, generally classified as buffers, have \\nbeen added to high-concentrate finishing diets to con\\xad\\ntrol low-rumen pH found when high-grain diets are fed. \\nThese products include sodium bicarbonate, dolomitic \\nlimestone, ground limestone, bentonite, and magne\\xad\\nsium oxide. Sodium bicarbonate will apparently in\\xad\\ncrease the pH of rumen contents by replacing sodium \\nbicarbonate from saliva, which is reduced in high-con\\xad\\ncentrate rations. Sodium bicarbonate and other prod\\xad\\nucts may exert their beneficial effects by other methods, \\nsuch as increasing rumen liquid turnover, increasing os\\xad\\nmolality of the rumen, and increasing the pH of the \\nlower intestinal tract. For a detailed discussion of this \\nsubject area, the reader is referred to the National Feed \\nIngredients Association Symposium on Buffers, Electro\\xad\\nlytes and Neutrolytes, 1983. \\nThe use of nonnutrient additives and implants is con\\xad\\ntrolled by the Food and Drug Administration in the \\nUnited States and the Food Production and Inspection \\nBranch of Agriculture Canada.

If \\nthose feeds are to be used with prediction equations in \\nthis report, the ME and NE values need to be recalcu\\xad\\nlated using the above equations . For some feedstuffs, \\nenergy values are not available from digestibility trials. \\n47 Coinposition of \\nFeeds and Mineral \\nSuppleinents \\nDigestibility energy values may be estimated from the \\nfollowing formula: \\nDE (Meal/kg) = 0.0504 CP% + 0.0770 EE% \\n+ 0.0200CF% + 0.000377NFE2% \\n+ 0.0110 NFE% -0.152. \\nThis formula and a listing of unusual and by-product \\nfeeds for cattle are included in Western Regional E:xten\\xad\\nsion Publication Number 39, Cooperative Extension \\nService, University of California, Berkeley, 94720. \\nIt should be realized that the values given in Table 8 \\nare the best estimate of the composition of that particu\\xad\\nlar feed for beef cattle. Many factors affect the composi\\xad\\ntion of feeds, such as soil conditions and climate, and \\nthese should be taken into consideration . \\nWhere data are available, plant cell constituents are \\ngiven, because of the increasing use of these values in \\ndietary formulations. When available, values are also \\ngiven for crude fiber. \\nTable 9 lists the minerals commonly used in dietary \\nformulations for beef cattle.
